Rugby-No overall link between concussion, cognitive function in ex-players over 50 - study¬"Oct 20 (Reuters) - Retired male rugby players aged 50 and over who have had at least three concussions in their careers have no worse average cognitive function overall compared with those who sustained none, one or two concussions, a study has found. The BRAIN study, funded by the Drake Foundation and conducted with assistance from England's Rugby Football Union (RFU), also found no relation between the number of rugby-related concussions and players' positions or career lengths. The study, which worked with 146 retired elite players, found no worsening of cognitive function in the group overall and in players under the age of 75. However, 14 of the 48 players over 75 who had suffered at least three concussions during their careers had significantly worse cognitive function on average than those who had experienced none, one or two concussions. Those players, or 29% of the over 75s who had sustained at least three concussions, could be at greater risk of problems such as memory loss, the study found. All the players in the study had featured for either England, Oxford University or Cambridge University in the pre-professional era of rugby, with the authors saying more research was needed into those who have played more recently. ""The agreed group of participants were aged 50+ principally because of the greater likelihood that we might detect any neurocognitive decline if present,"" RFU medical services director Simon Kemp said in a statement. ""It is important to also conduct research with younger retired players."" A group of former rugby players filed a class-action lawsuit against World Rugby and other governing bodies in December, alleging their failure to protect them led to early onset of dementia. The governing bodies have said they take player safety ""very seriously"". Last month, World Rugby announced new guidelines limiting full contact training to 15 minutes per week, following their six-point welfare plan in July which included brain health care for former players. The Drake Foundation said it had surveyed 508 adults involved in rugby and found two-thirds of respondents believed the sport needed fundamental law changes to make it safer. The research, published earlier this month, found 62% of adults involved in grassroots rugby were concerned about its long-term effects on brain health, while 61% believed the sport had become more dangerous since turning professional in 1995. ""The Drake Foundation is calling on rugby's authorities to give this immediate consideration to protect the sport we love and the current and future generations who play it,"" founder James Drake said in a statement. ""In my view it's a sport that has become ostensibly less safe for the players involved and my concerns are reflected by our research this month.""

Europe midday: Shares flat on mixed earnings; Husqvarna powers ahead¬"(Sharecast News) - European shares were barely moving the needle on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed bag of corporate earnings news. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.05% in early deals as Asian and US markets closed higher overnight. UK shares were flat as inflation fell unexpectedly in September, and traders were still factoring in an early rise in interest rates next month. September inflation fell back to 3.1% from 3.2% in August September despite the rising cost of fuel and transport, according to official data and still well above the Bank of England's target of 2%. ""The latest numbers don't include the petrol pump crisis or the most recent surge in energy prices, or indeed the knock on effects across the economy, so inflation will still get worse before it gets better,"" said AJ Bell analyst Laith Khalaf. In equity news French luxury goods maker Kering fell as sales growth at its fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in the pace of its post-Covid recovery, particularly in Asia. Shares in its French rival LVMH and Hermes also fell on the news. ASML Holdings, which supplies computer chip, fell despite posting slightly better-than-expected quarterly results. Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel fell 1.61% as quarterly earnings were hit by continued raw material inflation and supply chain disruptions, which it expects to continue through mid-2022. Shares in Sweden's Husqvarna Group topped the Stoxx as the maker chainsaws, mowers and tractors reported a rise in third quarter sales. Swiss food giant Nestle rose 3.6% after the company lifted its sales outlook after strong coffee sales and price hikes pushed organic sales 6.5% higher in the third quarter. Roche shares fell, despite the Swiss drugmaker posting an 8% rise in nine-month revenues, powered by demand for Covid-19 tests, and lifted guidance. Deliveroo shares rose as the online food delivery firm reported a 58% rise in order values for the third quarter.

Britain's Lloyds Bank to close another 48 branches¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group will close a further 48 branches across England and Wales, the British lender said on Wednesday, as it seeks to further cut costs by trimming its physical network. The closures are the latest in a string of such moves by the bank, which in June announced the closure of 44 different branches. Banks have stepped up branch closures after many paused restructuring for much of last year to focus on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The announcement by Lloyds Banking Group of closing a further 48 bank branches is a complete betrayal of the communities and staff who have long supported this highly profitable business,"" said Sharon Graham, general secretary of employment union Unite. Lloyds said it is responding to customers using branches less frequently, and that it is piloting a scheme whereby 'community bankers' visit customers in their areas.

Eurozone inflation rises as expected in September¬"(Sharecast News) - Eurozone inflation rose as expected in September, according to data released on Wednesday by Eurostat. Consumer price inflation increased to 3.4% from 3.0% in August, in line with the initial estimate. The headline number came in well above the European Central Bank's 2% target, mainly due to a 17.6% jump in energy prices on the year. The cost of food, alcohol and tobacco also contributed, up 2%. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile elements such as food and fuel, edged up 0.3 percentage points to 1.9%, also in line with the initial estimate. Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Eurozone inflation looks set to climb further in the coming months as higher input and energy costs feed through. ""An unusually cold winter would put even more upward pressure on gas prices in the short term, but we still think that headline and core inflation will fall sharply next year to well below 2%."""¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 12:40¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/eurozone-inflation-rises-as-expected-in-september-8q4hxuaqiwgjiup.html
Bacanora Lithium capital reduction plans get court approval¬"(Sharecast News) - Bacanora Lithium said on Wednesday that its capital reduction plans had now been approved by the High Court, as it updated the market on the Sonora Project. The AIM-traded firm said the capital reduction would become effective on the registration of the court order by the Registrar of Companies, which was expected ""shortly"". It said it had also received approval by RK Mine Finance Bermuda 3, or 'Red Kite', under the terms of the company's $150m senior debt facility, for the reduction of share capital and the distribution of the shares in Zinnwald Lithium. The distribution of the 90,619,170 shares in Zinnwald Lithium would be subject to a number of conditions, including the offer from Ganfeng International Trading Shanghai being declared unconditional, and the expiry of the regulatory lock-in restrictions relating to the transfer of Zinnwald shares on 29 October. ""The making of the distribution, and the transfer of the shares in Zinnwald Lithium to shareholders, subject to the distribution conditions having been satisfied will, in any event, occur no earlier than 30 October,"" the board said in its statement. Looking at the Sonora Project, the company said lithium process plant engineering from the Ganfeng team in Xinyu was aiming for long-lead items to be ordered for delivery to Sonora in late 2022 and early 2023. In addition, Ganfeng was reviewing a lithium plant production rate above the previously-planned 17,500 tonnes per year. Earthworks surveys and geotechnical testwork was ongoing within the plant site area, where surface vegetation and topsoil was rescued and removed. Additionally, Bacanora said it had acquired an additional 500 hectares of land at the eastern end of the plant site location, to allow for future plant expansions. ""As a result of the ongoing Covid-19-related travel restrictions, the site earthworks engineering packages that had previously been rescheduled will now commence in December 2021, with civil and concrete works scheduled for the first and second quarters of  2022,"" the board said in its statement. ""The accommodation facilities for the construction teams are now being manufactured in Sonora, and the first camp units will be delivered to site in December.

LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks drift; pound dips after UK inflation data¬"(Alliance News) -Â Markets were trading sideways on Wednesday as traders mulled what a deceleration in the UK inflation rate could mean for the Bank of England's meeting next month. Focus in the day ahead lies on another busy day for US corporate earnings, with the likes of Tesla, Verizon and IBM reporting. The FTSE 100 index was up just up just 2.87 points at 7,220.40 on Wednesday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 46.44 points, or 0.2%, at 23,007.65. The AIM All-Share index was down 1.19 points, or 0.1%, at 1,238.71. The Cboe UK 100 index was flat at 716.26. The Cboe 250 was down 0.5% at 20,720.30 and the Cboe Small Companies down 0.3% at 15,559.72. In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.1%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.1% on Wednesday. ""European markets are struggling to gain traction in early trade today, despite a welcome decline in UK CPI inflation that could take some of the heat off the Bank of England,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. Data early Wednesday showed the UK inflation rate unexpectedly eased a touch last month. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. The pound tumbled following the inflation data, quoted at USD1.3784 from USD1.3800 at the London equities close on Tuesday, suggesting doubts could be setting in over imminent monetary policy tightening. However, Laith Khalaf at AJ Bell cautioned: ""The latest numbers don't include the petrol pump crisis or the most recent surge in energy prices, or indeed the knock-on effects across the economy, so inflation will still get worse before it gets better."" There were no surprises in the eurozone, where the annual inflation rate for September was confirmed at 3.4%, picking up from 3.0% in August. The highest contribution to September's consumer price inflation rate came from energy prices, followed by services and non-energy industrial goods. The euro traded at USD1.1632 midday Wednesday, soft against USD1.1640 late Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JPY114.43 from JPY114.23. Gold was quoted at USD1,779.89 an ounce early Wednesday, higher than USD1,772.17 on Tuesday. Brent oil was trading at USD84.16 a barrel, easing from USD84.64 late Tuesday. Wall Street is on track for a flat start as investors ready for another earnings-packed day. Reporting on Wednesday are electric car maker Tesla, telecommunications firm Verizon, and IT firm IBM. Netflix late Tuesday reported a rise in earnings and subscriber growth as the subscription-based video streaming provider hailed its hit show 'Squid Game'. However, shares were trading 2.4% lower pre-market as it warned its operating margin in the fourth quarter to set to tumbled to 6.5% from 14% a year ago. ""The likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence and Dwayne Johnson do not come cheap it would appear. If this is the kind of big budget spending the group now needs to keep up with rivals that is bad news for long-term profits,"" commented Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett on Netflix's margin. In the UK, Antofagasta was weighing on the FTSE 100, down 3.8% after it warned copper output is set to slip next year. In the third quarter ended September 30, copper output reached 181,100 tonnes, up 1.5% from 178,400 tonnes in the previous quarter. Higher output reflected increased production at Centinela, offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres, the company said. Antofagasta maintained its full-year copper production guidance of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes. For 2022, however, it now expects slightly lower output of between 660,000 and 690,000 tonnes. In the FTSE 250, Hammerson shares slipped 3.4% after the shopping centre owner said footfall is struggling to reach 2019 levels. The FTSE 250-listed real estate investment trust, which owns shopping centres and mixed-use developments across Europe, said overall footfall in all territories was still 15% to 20% below 2019 levels. Rent collection rates improved, with 70% of group billable rent collected for the fourth quarter of 2020 so far. This is ""significantly ahead of any quarter since the first quarter of 2020 at the same point in time"", the firm noted. Deliveroo shares rose 3.5% after the food delivery firm lifted its outlook after a ""strong"" third quarter, even as pandemic restrictions largely eased. The food delivery firm reported annual growth in gross transaction value of 54% in the third quarter of 2021 at GBP1.59 billion, describing orders as ""resilient"" despite lockdown restrictions being eased in the UK. It did note a ""modest"" reduction in average order value, with this slipping 6% year-on-year to GBP21.4 from GBP22.8. On the back of this, Deliveroo raised its full-year gross transaction value guidance to growth of 60% to 70%, versus prior guidance of 50% to 60%. Its margin outlook was unchanged, seen in a range of 7.50% to 7.75%. On AIM, shares in Arena Events jumped 43% after agreeing to be taken over by Theta Bidco in deal worth enterprise value of GBP95.1 million. The suitor - owned by joint offerors IHC Industrial Holding and Tasheel Holding Group - will pay 21 pence per Arena share, being a 48% premium to Tuesday's closing price.

Phoenix Copper upbeat on latest work at Red Star¬"(Sharecast News) - United States-focussed base and precious metals explorer and producer Phoenix Copper issued results from the ground magnetics survey at its Red Star project in Custer County, Idaho on Wednesday, 330 metres northwest along strike from the present northern limits of the proposed Empire Mine open pit. The AIM-traded firm said Red Star appears to be part of the same mineralised system as the Empire Mine. It said three holes drilled in 2018 generated a maiden NI 43-101 compliant resource of 1.6 million silver-equivalent ounces, with silver grades as high as 1,100 grams per tonne, lead grades above 21%. An additional 10 holes were drilled in 2020, and the company commissioned a ground-based magnetics geophysical survey to better understand the nature and orientation of potential mineralisation, and to inform the location and direction of a further drilling programme. It said on Wednesday that four high-amplitude areas of interest had been identified, including the discovery outcrop that was drilled in 2018 and 2020. The size and amplitude of the three new areas of interest appeared to be ""significantly greater"" than that of the discovery outcrop, which generated a maiden resource in 2018, with further north-northeast magnetic anomalies trending from the Red Star discovery outcrop also identified. Phoenix said the survey results would be used to guide the location and direction of the upcoming drill programme at Red Star, while further survey results were awaited for the Horseshoe-White Knob area to the north, and the Navarre Creek gold project. ""The size and amplitude of the three new anomalies are significantly greater than that of the discovery outcrop which generated the initial maiden resource for Red Star,"" said chief executive officer Ryan McDermott. ""Understanding these three new anomalies better is now a priority and will be the focus of additional drilling. ""The survey also identified a trend of lesser magnetic anomalies which roughly parallels the patented claim boundary, trending off the patented claims to the northeast."" McDermott said that was the same trend that was targeted in 2020 using float and sub-crop geochemistry, and would also be the subject of future drill targeting. ""The Red Star drilling program is planned to expand the NI 43-101 compliant 2018 maiden resource of 103,500 tonnes, which resulted from the 2018 drilling. ""Approximately 3,000 metres of new drilling has been budgeted at Red Star and Horseshoe and is currently being targeted using the recent magnetics data, as well as existing geological and geochemical information."" Ryan McDermott said that while the company's team remained ""healthy and productive"", Covid-19-related delays in the shipping of parts and materials, as well as contact tracing quarantine requirements, had delayed a number of its contractors, vendors and suppliers. ""We are encouraged by the magnetic survey results received to date and are continuing our exploration programs as quickly as we can. ""We appreciate everyone's patience and look forward to reporting additional information and data as soon as it is received.""

LIVE MARKETS-Strong earnings to alleviate refinancing needs ¬"* European stocks, Wall Street futures flat * Nestle shines * Kering, ASML disappoint * Miners worst performers across STOXX 600 * Bundesbank's Weidmann quits Oct 20 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com STRONG EARNINGS TO ALLEVIATE REFINANCING NEEDS (1156 GMT) After a borrowing spree in 2020 to bolster liquidity amid the COVID pandemic, total debt of EMEA speculative-grade companies analysed by Moody's is now stable at $1.6 trillion, unchanged since last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Telecoms has overtaken autos to become the sector with highest level of debt per company. The good news is stronger earnings this year will alleviate companies refinancing needs. ""Higher cash reserves, improved free cash flow will provide some leeway on the amount of debt that needs to be refinanced"", the rating agency said. Moody's analysts forecast EMEA speculative-grade companies will generate 60 billion dollars more in free cash flow in next year than in 2020. But things will go differently depending on sectors: high- capital spending or dividend heavy businesses, such as utilities, transport and real estate, will have ""weak or negative free cash flow"", Moody's say. While the main increases will arise in the sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, automotive, services and energy, they add. (Joice Alves) ***** DANONE: DOWN! NESTLE: UP! UNILEVER? (1017 GMT) Inflation is definitely a key theme for this earnings season and so far, not all stocks are weathering that storm in the same way. It's particularly obvious among consumer staples with Danone falling 3% yesterday after executives at the French yoghurt giant warned of price rising for milk, ingredients, packaging and shipping. It's a different story for Nestle this morning. The Swiss consumer group is up 3.5% after raising its sales target and beating consensus amid strong coffee sales. All in all, the kitkat maker's earnings made a convincing case. ""We see this beat as reassuring after yesterday’s negative read across from peers"", a Citi note commented, while other analysts stressed that popular consumer staples have a decisive edge up their sleeve against inflation. ""Most companies with strong brands will be able to pass on prices and I think the market still does not get that,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox when commenting on Nestle's results. Procter & Gamble said on Tuesday it would raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the U.S. to counter higher commodity and freight costs. How successful big brands will be in convincing consumers to gobble some inflation rather than buying less popular but cheaper products? Investors interested in finding out will be looking closely at Unilever's results tomorrow to see whether the maker of Knorr soups will cut its profit margin forecast for the second time this year. Unilever makes about 60% of its turnover in emerging markets, where inflation is fiercest. All in all though, consumer staples have been struggling to keep up with the broader market. ""This may be partly due to how investors have been looking for cyclical companies that could benefit from an economic upturn in the wake of pandemic, and show a rapid recovery in earnings, such as oils, banks and miners, rather than Steady Eddies like Unilever"", AJ Bell analysts argued last week in a note. Below you can see how Danone, Unilever and Nestle, big defensive stocks, outperformed the STOXX 600 in the aftermath of the COVID-19 and how they now trail behind: Some reading: P&G to increase prices further as commodity, freight costs bite Inflation trade? Nestle reaps benefits from higher prices Danone warns of growing cost pressures into 2022 (Julien Ponthus) ***** THE TWO SIDES OF BRITAIN PLC IN A CHART (0959 GMT) A revival in value, banks and energy stocks, coupled with a weaker sterling is boosting interest for UK large-caps. But on the other hand, growing post-Brexit challenges and the prospect of higher interest rates weigh on UK domestic companies. As a result, the exporter-focused FTSE 100 -- which makes about 60% of its revenue abroad -- is thriving, while UK mid caps are lagging behind. Barclays sees rising risks for domestic recovery weighing on the FTSE 250 -- heavy on industrials, discretionary, staples, and diversified financials, all sectors that could be pressured by a slowdown in the UK economy. ""We see challenges from Brexit compounding COVID-related supply issues and an unfavourable mix of early fiscal and monetary tightening,"" Barclays says. (Joice Alves) ****** EUROPEAN SHARES SEEK DIRECTION AFTER MIXED BATCH OF EARNINGS (0750 GMT) European shares are edging up as traders digest a batch of mixed earnings results. The pan-European STOXX 600 started the day in the red but it has gained some grounds and is now 0.1% higher. Strong results from Swiss food giant Nestle, which raised its sales outlook, were partially offset by underwhelming reports from French luxury group Kering and Dutch semiconductor company ASML. Kering tumbles 4% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of COVID recovery, particularly in Asia. London blue chips are little changed as fears that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in two weeks persist as the unexpected slowdown in inflation in September is seen as temporary. Shares in Antofagasta slip to the bottom of the FTSE after its Q3 production report. Other miners -- Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American -- are among the worst performers in London on lower metal prices. (Joice Alves) **** MARGIN PRESSURES (0718 GMT) Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Sujata Rao) ***** INFLATION DATA, EARNINGS FOR BREAKFAST (0640 GMT) Futures are pointing to a start of the day in the red for European bourses amid cautious about the global economic outlook with rising inflation expectations driving the market. Data showed this morning, British inflation slowed unexpectedly in September but the decline probably marked a temporary respite for consumers and the Bank of England is expected to address the acceleration by raising interests rates, possibly in two weeks. In the corporate front, as a slew of companies are reporting their earnings, traders are getting some much-needed guidance.

Unite says Lloyds 'betrays communities' with announcement of further branch closures¬"(Sharecast News) - Trade union Unite has accused Lloyds Banking Group of betraying communities as a result of its move to shutter a further 48 bank branches. Lloyds said on Wednesday that it would close another 48 branches across the UK, leading to the possible loss of 178 jobs. Unite claims the closures of the ""much needed and valued bank branches"" will deny access to vital services and cash to thousands of Lloyds customers, with the vulnerable, elderly, and financially excluded being hit the hardest. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""The announcement by Lloyds Banking Group of closing a further 48 bank branches is a complete betrayal of the communities and staff who have long supported this highly profitable business. ""This sector needs to start taking their corporate social responsibilities seriously and stop neglecting their obligations to their customers and workforce. Banks are leaving people behind in the rush to close bank branches and force consumers to go cashless to boost their mega-profits. It's [a] classic example of putting profits before people."" Unite stated that the time for the banking industry to have a legal commitment to protect access to cash and bank branches was ""overdue"", particularly in communities ""blighted by social deprivation"". ""We cannot allow the most vulnerable in our society to continue to be overlooked by the banking sector; bank branches and ATMs are vital public services for us all,"" added Unite. As of 1310 BST, Lloyds shares were down 1.46% at 48.68p."¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 12:27¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/unite-says-lloyds-betrays-communities-with-announcement-of-further-branch-closures-u3hbpxc5law8tpg.html
Sunak to slash tax surcharge on bank profits - report¬(Sharecast News) - The chancellor Rishi Sunak plans to cut the surcharge on banks' profits, it was reported on Wednesday. Sunak wants to reduce the tax surcharge from 8% to 3% from April 2023, the Financial Times reported. Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said the move was intended to keep banking activity in the UK when corporation taxes increase. The chancellor was keen to ensure banks paid a fair share of taxation while maintaining competitiveness and protecting jobs, the FT said. At the March Budget, Sunak announced general corporation tax rates would rise to 25% from 19% from 2023. But he also announced plans to review the tax surcharge, to ensure UK-based banks could compete against rivals in the US and European Union. The financial sector has long lobbied against the 8% surcharge, which raised £1.5bn in the 2019-20 year. It was introduced on profits above £25m by then chancellor George Osborne in 2015. Sunak is due to present his autumn Budget on 27 October.¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 12:10¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/sunak-to-slash-tax-surcharge-on-bank-profits---report-ihz59p8i9if121b.html

Soccer-Bruce says Newcastle job may be last managerial role after exit¬"Oct 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bruce said his stint at Newcastle United could be his last managerial role after the 60-year-old left the club on Wednesday following a poor start to their Premier League campaign and the takeover of the side by a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium. Bruce, who has been the target of fans' ire since replacing the popular Rafa Benitez in 2019, left by mutual consent with the team in 19th place and winless after eight games. ""I think this might be my last job. It's not just about me; it's taken its toll on my family because they are all Geordies and I can't ignore that,"" Bruce told The Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/10/20/steve-bruce-sacked-newcastle-reveals-hard-called-inept-cabbage. ""They've been worried about me... especially my wife Jan... She dealt with the death of my parents, hers have not been very well. And then she had me to worry about and what I've been going through the last couple of years. ""... I'm 60 years old and I don't know if I want to put her through it again. We've got a good life so... this will probably be me done as a manager until I get a phone call from a chairman somewhere asking if I can give them a hand. Never say never, I've learnt that."" Bruce, a boyhood Newcastle fan, said the abuse directed at him by supporters was difficult to take. ""To never really be wanted, to feel that people wanted me to fail, to read people constantly saying I would fail, that I was useless, a fat waste of space, a stupid, tactically inept cabbage head... And it was from day one,"" Bruce added. ""When we were doing OK results wise, it was 'yeah but the style of football is rubbish' or I was just 'lucky.' It was ridiculous and persistent, even when the results were good. ""The best one was to be told we were a relegation team in all but points... this was all in the first season. We finished 13th.

LIVE MARKETS-Danone: down! Nestle: up! Unilever? ¬"* European stocks, Wall Street futures flat * Nestle shines, Kering, ASML disappoint * Miners worst performers across STOXX 600 * UK inflation slows in September * Bundesbank's Weidmann quits * Oct 20 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com DANONE: DOWN! NESTLE: UP! UNILEVER? (1017 GMT) Inflation is definitely a key theme for this earnings season and so far, not all stocks are weathering that storm in the same way. It's particularly obvious among consumer staples with Danone falling 3% yesterday after executives at the French yoghurt giant warned of price rising for milk, ingredients, packaging and shipping. It's a different story for Nestle this morning. The Swiss consumer group is up 3.5% after raising its sales target and beating consensus amid strong coffee sales. All in all, the kitkat maker's earnings made a convincing case. ""We see this beat as reassuring after yesterday’s negative read across from peers"", a Citi note commented, while other analysts stressed that popular consumer staples have a decisive edge up their sleeve against inflation. ""Most companies with strong brands will be able to pass on prices and I think the market still does not get that,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox when commenting on Nestle's results. Procter & Gamble said on Tuesday it would raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the U.S. to counter higher commodity and freight costs. How successful big brands will be in convincing consumers to gobble some inflation rather than buying less popular but cheaper products? Investors interested in finding out will be looking closely at Unilever's results tomorrow to see whether the maker of Knorr soups will cut its profit margin forecast for the second time this year. Unilever makes about 60% of its turnover in emerging markets, where inflation is fiercest. All in all though, consumer staples have been struggling to keep up with the broader market. ""This may be partly due to how investors have been looking for cyclical companies that could benefit from an economic upturn in the wake of pandemic, and show a rapid recovery in earnings, such as oils, banks and miners, rather than Steady Eddies like Unilever"", AJ Bell analysts argued last week in a note. Below you can see how Danone, Unilever and Nestle, big defensive stocks, outperformed the STOXX 600 in the aftermath of the COVID-19 and how they now trail behind: Some reading: P&G to increase prices further as commodity, freight costs bite Inflation trade? Nestle reaps benefits from higher prices Danone warns of growing cost pressures into 2022 (Julien Ponthus) ***** THE TWO SIDES OF BRITAIN PLC IN A CHART (0959 GMT) A revival in value, banks and energy stocks, coupled with a weaker sterling is boosting interest for UK large-caps. But on the other hand, growing post-Brexit challenges and the prospect of higher interest rates weigh on UK domestic companies. As a result, the exporter-focused FTSE 100 -- which makes about 60% of its revenue abroad -- is thriving, while UK mid caps are lagging behind. Barclays sees rising risks for domestic recovery weighing on the FTSE 250 -- heavy on industrials, discretionary, staples, and diversified financials, all sectors that could be pressured by a slowdown in the UK economy. ""We see challenges from Brexit compounding COVID-related supply issues and an unfavourable mix of early fiscal and monetary tightening,"" Barclays says. (Joice Alves) ****** EUROPEAN SHARES SEEK DIRECTION AFTER MIXED BATCH OF EARNINGS (0750 GMT) European shares are edging up as traders digest a batch of mixed earnings results. The pan-European STOXX 600 started the day in the red but it has gained some grounds and is now 0.1% higher. Strong results from Swiss food giant Nestle, which raised its sales outlook, were partially offset by underwhelming reports from French luxury group Kering and Dutch semiconductor company ASML. Kering tumbles 4% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of COVID recovery, particularly in Asia. London blue chips are little changed as fears that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in two weeks persist as the unexpected slowdown in inflation in September is seen as temporary. Shares in Antofagasta slip to the bottom of the FTSE after its Q3 production report. Other miners -- Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American -- are among the worst performers in London on lower metal prices. (Joice Alves) **** MARGIN PRESSURES (0718 GMT) Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Sujata Rao) ***** INFLATION DATA, EARNINGS FOR BREAKFAST (0640 GMT) Futures are pointing to a start of the day in the red for European bourses amid cautious about the global economic outlook with rising inflation expectations driving the market.

Lawmakers probe timeline of NatWest money laundering investigation¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British lawmakers have asked the Financial Conduct Authority why it took five years to prosecute NatWest for failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds ($551.28 million), after the lender pled guilty earlier this month. The bank on Oct. 7 admitted three criminal charges of not adequately monitoring customer accounts between 2012 and 2016, the first time a bank in Britain acknowledged it committed a criminal offence of this kind. ""There are questions which remain to be answered, most notably why it has taken five years after the police raid in 2016 to bring this case to a successful conclusion,"" Mel Stride, chair of the cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said in a letter to the FCA published on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the FCA declined to comment. Stride said the committee is also looking into why no individual NatWest staff were prosecuted. The FCA in the case alleged NatWest had failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash. NatWest could face a potential penalty https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/natwest-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-offences-2021-10-07 of around 340 million pounds under sentencing guidelines, although a judge will set the level of any fine later this year.

Europe open: Shares higher as investors mull mixed earnings bag¬"(Sharecast News) - European shares opened higher on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed bag of corporate earnings news. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.14% in early deals as Asian and US markets closed higher overnight. UK shares were flat as inflation fell unexpectedly in September, but traders were still factoring in an early rise in interest rates next month. September inflation fell back to 3.1% from 3.2% in August September despite the rising cost of fuel and transport, according to official data and still well above the Bank of England's target of 2%. ""The latest numbers don't include the petrol pump crisis or the most recent surge in energy prices, or indeed the knock on effects across the economy, so inflation will still get worse before it gets better,"" said AJ Bell analyst Laith Khalaf. In equity news French luxury goods maker Kering fell 4.6% as sales growth at its fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in the pace of its post-Covid recovery, particularly in Asia. Shares in its French rival LVMH and Hermes also fell on the news. ASML Holdings, which supplies computer chip, fell 1.73% despite posting slightly better-than-expected quarterly results. Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel fell 1.61% as quarterly earnings were hit by continued raw material inflation and supply chain disruptions, which it expects to continue through mid-2022. Shares in Swiss food giant Nestle rose 3.6% after the company lifted its sales outlook after strong coffee sales and price hikes pushed organic sales 6.5% higher in the third quarter. Roche shares fell, despite the Swiss drugmaker posting an 8% rise in nine-month revenues, powered by demand for Covid-19 tests, and lifted guidance. Deliveroo shares rose as the online food delivery firm reported a 58% rise in order values for the third quarter.

The hefty fines announced late on Tuesday by British and U.S. regulators in the Mozambique case as well as a rare rebuke by Swiss regulators over the spying affair mark a low ebb for a Swiss bank that was once a pillar of the economy. Credit Suisse, which brought in seasoned banker Antonio Horta-Osario as chairman in April to stop the rot, said in response that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance. Nonetheless, the scandals, coupled with heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos and the hit to the bank's clients from the demise of British financier Greensill, have prompted debate about strengthening Swiss banking controls. ""The scandals expose a cultural problem,"" said Gerhard Andrey, a Green Party lawmaker in Switzerland's parliament who is pushing for tighter regulation. ""We need more power to tackle the top ranks of management at these banks, who always walk away unscathed from such scandals."" Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Swiss investment adviser Ethos, called on Wednesday on Credit Suisse to claw back bonuses paid to managers involved in the various scandals and consider taking legal action against them. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was penalised $547 million by British and U.S. regulators for secret loans to Mozambique, whose discovery prompted donors to withdraw support for the southern African country and triggered its economic collapse. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Credit Suisse had hidden the true nature of the loans, which were meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet, including the payment of $200 million in kickbacks to its bankers and government officials in Mozambique. ""Credit Suisse, through its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, engaged in a global criminal conspiracy to defraud investors,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in the DOJ statement. The DOJ said Credit Suisse would have to pay British and U.S. regulators $475 million, after taking into account crediting and other resolutions. Speaking for Mozambique's attorney general, Keith Oliver at law firm Peters & Peters said it was an ""important step towards obtaining full redress for the people of Mozambique"" and the country would bring those responsible to justice. 'UNJUSTIFIED OBSERVATION' The string of scandals at Credit Suisse have rattled faith in the Swiss bank founded to finance the building of the nation's rail network that tunnels through the Alps. Shareholders have deserted the bank following the slew of bad headlines and a tepid performance. Its shares are down 14% this year while the Swiss blue chip index has climbed 11%. Separately, Swiss regulators accused Credit Suisse on Tuesday of misleading them about the scale of spying the bank was undertaking in a scandal that forced the departure last year of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. The crisis erupted when Credit Suisse's former star wealth manager Iqbal Khan, who had defected to arch Swiss rival UBS , confronted a private detective trailing him through downtown Zurich. As more details came to light, one private investigator involved in the scandal committed suicide, intensifying the outcry. Credit Suisse, however, repeatedly played down this and another episode of spying as isolated incidents. But the Swiss Financial market Supervisory Authority FINMA said on Tuesday that the bank planned spying operations on seven occasions between 2016 and 2019, and carried out most of them. It said the bank had sought to cover its tracks by using external text messaging services and ""rudimentary invoices"". It said several members of the executive board were informed of planned spying on an employee in Asia in 2019. Criticising the banks for serious shortcomings in its governance, FINMA said it had launched enforcement proceedings against three individuals. The bank said it regretted that it did not ""ensure all relevant information was readily available"" to FINMA and that it condemned any ""unjustified observation"". The scandals have angered FINMA officials, who struggle to hold bankers to account because Swiss rules only allow them to sanction directors if they are directly involved in wrongdoing, rather than for general managerial lapses. Despite more than $15 billion in writedowns and penalties in recent years at Credit Suisse, dissenting shareholders also failed to oust chairman Urs Rohner before he retired this year. Cedric Wermuth, a Swiss lawmaker from the Social Democratic Party, backed calls for tighter banking controls. ""We will have more cases in the future like this unless we have stronger regulation,"" he said.

Motor racing-Andretti entering F1 would be a logical move, says Stroll¬"By Alan Baldwin LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Andretti Autosport would be a great addition to Formula One if reported takeover talks with Sauber come to fruition, according to Aston Martin's billionaire Canadian owner Lawrence Stroll. Swiss-based Sauber run the Alfa Romeo team and there is mounting speculation that Michael Andretti, a former grand prix racer and son of 1978 champion Mario, is close to a deal. [nL4N2R506Z American motorsports website Racer.com reported however that no announcement was expected at this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. ""Andretti's a great name. I know the family and I think they'd be a great addition to the sport, if it's true,"" Stroll told Reuters from Montreal ahead of Sunday's race when asked about the rumours. ""I don't know much about it other than that I heard in the paddock last race that there was potentially some activity there. ""I think they did a SPAC in the States and said they were going to look to buy something in motorsports. I fully get it, I see the logic."" The Andretti family set up a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) this year to raise $250 million through an initial public offering. The United States is a key growth area for Formula One, owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media, with a second race in Miami coming in 2022. Stroll, who made his money in fashion, bought a significant stake in British sportscar maker Aston Martin in 2020 and is the executive chairman. The Silverstone-based Formula One team he bought in 2018 now competes as Aston Martin and Stroll has big plans for the future. A new factory and wind tunnel 'campus' is being built and the team this month launched a five-year sterling retail bond through the London Stock Exchange to help fund a project due for completion in three years' time. Stroll said the offer was also a chance for the team's fans and employees to become financially involved with a minimum initial subscription of 1,000 pounds ($1,376.40) and multiples of 100. ""This will be a substantial amount of what the total facility will cost,"" said the Canadian, who added that the latest cost estimate was around 220 million pounds. Stroll said Formula One's introduction of a budget cap this season, dropping to $135 million in 2023, would transform the business. ""Everybody is very focused on each of us being profitable. And Formula One teams, run properly, will be very profitable companies,"" he said. ""It's a lot easier to win when you're outspending the competition. That has now gone... that plays into the sweet spot of this team, who historically did more with less. ""We'll be able to do more, we'll be at the peak of the budget cap, we'll be right up there."" The value of Formula One teams has also been boosted by any new entrant having to pay a $200 million fee to compensate the existing 10 outfits for their reduced future share of the sport's overall revenues. This does not apply to anyone taking over an existing team.

TREASURIES-U.S. yield curve steepens after dovish signals from central banks ¬"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve widened on Tuesday, as investors unwound flattening moves of the last few sessions after global central banks dampened expectations of near-term tightening that spilled over to the world's largest bond market. The steepening of the curve extended further after weaker than-expected U.S. housing data. U.S. fed fund futures, which track short-term Federal Reserve rate expectations, on Tuesday priced a 64% chance of a rate hike in July next year, down from 82% on Monday. Fed tightening in August was at an 80% chance on Tuesday, down from 100% on Monday. The yield curve had flattened amid expectations the Fed will tighten interest rates, pushing yields on the short end higher. The yield spread between the U.S. 5-year note and U.S. 30-year bond widened to 90 basis points on Tuesday, On Monday, the U.S. 5-year/30-year yield curve was at its flattest since late April 2020. The U.S. 5-year yield, which has come to reflect Fed rate hike expectations, has been on a tear the last two weeks, hitting its highest since February 2020 at 1.193%. The yield was last down 1 basis point at 1.1488%. Analysts said global central banks' dovish comments on Tuesday prompted some of the steepening moves. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the European Central Bank's policy-setting Governing Council, said on Tuesday there is no reason for the ECB to raise rates between now and the end of 2022 as euro zone inflation is expected to fall back below the ECB's 2% target. Earlier in the session, the Reserve Bank of Australia, in the minutes of its October policy meeting, said the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 had interrupted the Australian economy's recovery. It reiterated its view of no hike in the 0.1% cash rate until 2024 given sluggishness in wages and inflation. Aside from the dovish central bank messages, U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in September amid persistent shortages of inputs and labor that are crimping the housing market and overall economic activity. U.S. starts dropped 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.555 million units last month. The U.S. housing report briefly weighed on long-dated yields, before they resumed gains. ""The housing sector, though on the upswing, has recently stumbled,"" wrote Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in a report after the data. But ""they are still well above long-term demographic demand. Most forward-looking metrics on housing suggest it should turn up in Q4 of 2021 and H1 of 2022,"" he added. In late morning U.S. trading, U.S. 10-year yields were last up 3.4 basis points at 1.6161%. U.S. 30-year yields were also higher, up nearly 6 basis points at 2.0711%.

UK regulators set up climate taskforce to help actuaries¬"* Joint Forum on Actuarial Regulation plans report * To help actuaries better assess climate risks * Report due in the second quarter of 2022 By Simon Jessop LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - UK regulators said on Wednesday they would form a taskforce to publish a report on the science of climate change to help actuaries do a better job of assessing the risks posed by global warming. The decision by the executive of the Joint Forum on Actuarial Regulation comes ahead of global climate talks in Scotland, starting Oct. 31, and follows growing concern about the degree to which company accounts reflect climate risks. Established in 2013, JFAR includes the Financial Reporting Council, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the Financial Conduct Authority, The Pensions Regulator, and the Prudential Regulation Authority. In a statement, JFAR said the taskforce would investigate, report and publish a ""deep dive"" on the subject, which it hopes will lead to ""greater actuarial engagement on climate change in all aspects of actuarial work"". ""Most actuaries are well aware that something is happening to the climate but are less familiar with the specifics of the science,"" JFAR said in a statement. ""Bringing to life the specifics of the science of climate change in a format suitable for actuaries should lead to greater actuarial engagement on climate change."" JFAR exists to coordinate ""the identification and analysis of public interest risks to which actuarial work is relevant"", it said. Publication of the report is planned for the second quarter of 2022.

US pre-open: Futures point to flat open following Netflix earnings¬(Sharecast News) - Wall Street futures were pointing to a broadly flat open ahead of the bell on Wednesday after the S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight winning session. As of 1225 BST, Dow Jones futures were down 0.01%, while S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq-100 futures had the index opening 0.06% higher. The Dow closed 198.70 points higher on Tuesday as the release of some solid Q3 earnings from a number of big-name US firms gave sentiment a boost. In focus ahead of the bell, Netflix published its third-quarter earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, with the group reporting that it had snapped up 4.4m new subscribers during the period, ahead of estimates of 3.84m. However, Netflix stock traded lower in pre-market after analysts at Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock, stating its valuation was hard to justify given that revenue growth was expected to slow in 2022. United Airlines also released its quarterly results after the close, with the carrier coming in ahead of expectations on both the top and bottom line thanks to an ongoing rebound in travel demand. As far as Wednesday's earnings were concerned, Biogen reported smaller-than-anticipated quarterly sales of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm but still managed to beat expectations with group revenues of $2.78bn and earnings per share of $4.77, while Baker Hughes and Verizon will report their latest quarterly results later in the day and Tesla will publish earnings after the close. On the macro front, mortgage applications fell 6.3% in the week ended 15 October, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, principally due to an increase in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances from 3.18% to 3.23%. Applications to refinance a home fell 7% week-on-week, and those to purchase a home declined 4.9%.

Marlowe buying Riskwize for £25m, raising £50m in placing¬"(Sharecast News) - Business and regulatory compliance software and service provider Marlowe has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Riskwize and its wholly-owned subsidiary EssentialSkillz, it announced on Wednesday, for £25m. The AIM-traded firm said the acquisition would increase its run rate revenues and adjusted EBITDA to £335m and £60m, respectively, with an underlying divisional EBITDA margin of about 19%. Software annual recurring revenues would be increased by the acquisition to around £35m, achieving the company's medium-term digital target of 10% of group revenues being generated from software-as-a-service (SaaS). The board said it was confident of achieving its stated target of £100m run rate adjusted EBITDA by the end of the 2024 financial year, ahead of the original target set out in February of this year. Marlowe announced a proposed placing to raise £50m to fund the acquisition, as well as further near-term accretive bolt-on acquisitions. The placing was being conducted through an accelerated book build process, which opened immediately after its announcement on Wednesday morning. ""This acquisition of EssentialSkillz is the next step in our strategy to become the compliance software market leader,"" said chief executive officer Alex Dacre. ""EssentialSkillz is a leading compliance SaaS and eLearning business of scale and its merger with our new WorkNest platform further strengthens our one-stop-shop regulatory compliance offering for our clients.

Asia report: Tech stocks lead gains, China property sector stalls¬"(Sharecast News) - Equity markets were mixed on Wednesday in Asia, with Hong Kong shares rising strongly as Chinese technology names rose across the board. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was up 0.14% at 29,255.55, as the yen weakened 0.07% against the dollar to last trade at JPY 114.46. Automation specialist Fanuc was down 0.16%, while among the benchmark's other major components, fashion firm Fast Retailing was up 0.63% and technology conglomerate SoftBank Group jumped 4.4%. The broader Topix index eked out gains of 0.05% by the end of trading in Tokyo, closing at 2,027.67. On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.17% at 3,587.00, and the smaller, technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite was 0.11% weaker at 2,420.04. The People's Bank of China kept interest rates steady in its latest decision on Wednesday, with the one-year loan prime rate held at 3.85% and the five-year rate at 4.65%. Analysts and traders had expected the central bank to make no change according to a Reuters poll. ""Rate cuts would probably do little to help property developers, and could add to pressure on banks,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief China economist Craig Botham. ""More helpful is increasing the willingness of banks to lend - essentially to evergreen property developer credit - which the PBoC has been achieving so far through moral suasion. ""We continue to expect, however, a reserve ratio requirement (RRR) cut this quarter, as pressures will continue to mount, and bank losses start to rise."" Data on the country's property sector, meanwhile, showed new house prices seeing their first monthly decline in six years, while second-hand homes began to decline last month, before falling further in September, by 0.19% month-on-month. ""This provides further evidence of property market weakness in the wake of tighter government policy and the multiple defaults by assorted property developers,"" Craig Botham said. ""Falling prices threaten collateral values, developer and local government revenues, and consumer confidence, so the risk of contagion is building."" South Korea's Kospi was off 0.53% at 3,013.13, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong jumped 1.35% to 26,136.02. Chinese technology stocks were well above the waterline in the special administrative region, with Alibaba rocketing 6.67%, Meituan ahead 2.87% and Tencent 2.1% firmer. The gains came after it was reported that Alibaba founder Jack Ma was travelling Europe, having remained out of the public eye for several months after criticising Beijing regulators. China-based property names were mostly weaker, meanwhile, with China Vanke down 0.71% and Country Garden losing 0.64% in Hong Kong. That came following the house price data in mainland China, and after it was reported that debt-plagued developer China Evergrande had put the kibosh on plans to sell a majority stake in its property services division.

Arena Chair Ken Hanna says deal offers ""attractive value to shareholders"". He continues: ""The offer from the consortium represents a substantial premium to the Arena Group's existing share price and recognises the quality of Arena, the agility of the business to successfully rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic and its standing amongst its peers as the world of events returns to normality.

Houses prices spike ahead of stamp duty holiday ending¬"(Sharecast News) - UK house prices jumped in August, official data showed on Wednesday, as buyers rushed to secure homes before the stamp duty holiday came to an end. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK average house prices rose 10.6% over the year to August 2021, against an 8.5% rise in July. Month-on-month, house prices rose 2.8% on a seasonally-adjusted basis. The average house price is now £264,000, £25,000 higher than in August 2020. In England, house prices rose by 9.8% to £281,000; by 12.5% in Scotland to £181,000; and by 9.0% in Northern Ireland to £153,000. Across all regions, London showed the lowest annual growth, at 7.5%, for the ninth consecutive month. The stamp duty holiday was introduced in summer 2020 to help support the housing market following the first lockdown. Combined with a surge in demand for larger homes, it helped fuel a property boom. The tax break was phased out over the summer, however, and returned to its £125,000 threshold on 30 September. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""While the threshold already had declined to £250,00 at the start of July, most intended purchases were largely unaffected, because the average house price is £264,000. ""Timelier data suggest that demand has weakened following the return of the threshold to £125,000, but remains above its pre-Covid level.

Berenberg upgrades Moneysupermarket.com to 'buy'¬"(Sharecast News) - Analysts at Berenberg upped their rating on price comparison website business Moneysupermarket.com from 'hold' to 'buy' on Wednesday, stating it believes the shares were being valued on ""trough earnings at trough multiples"". Berenberg said macro headwinds for the firm will not last forever, acknowledging that Moneysupermarket.com's third-quarter earnings were ""expectedly weak"" as travel was still depressed by the overhang of Covid-19. ""While these trends result in a material re-basing of our FY 2021-22 revenue and EBITDA estimates, these macro headwinds will not last forever, and we are approaching the trough in our view,"" said the analysts. Berenberg said it expects organic growth to return in 2022 which, coupled with the acquisition of Quidco and improving margin trends, should drive ""a double-digit earnings compound annual growth rate"" in 2021-23. The German bank, which lowered its target price on the stock from 310.0p to 275.0p, also reckons Moneysupermarket.com could become a takeout target.

London midday: Stocks tread water as inflation dips¬"(Sharecast News) - London stocks were still treading water by midday on Wednesday as investors mulled the latest UK inflation figures. The FTSE 100 was flat at 7,220.76, while sterling was 0.2% weaker against the dollar at 1.3765. Data released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed consumer price inflation unexpectedly dipped in September despite the rising cost of fuel and transport. CPI fell to 3.1% from 3.2% in August, versus expectations for it to remain unchanged. Still, it remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, meaning it's unlikely to do anything to reduce expectations the BoE will raise interest rates before the end of the year. The decline was due mainly to the impact of last summer's 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme. The biggest downward contribution came from restaurants/cafes inflation, which fell to 3.9% in September from 7.9% the month before. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, slipped to 2.9% from 3.1%. ONS Head of Prices Mike Hardie said: ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out,' which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflation is expected to reach 4%, double the BoE's target by the end of the year, and potentially 5% by next April. ""With prices staying stubbornly high and another surge expected, a gentle rise in interest rates before the end of the year still looks likely if there is any chance of keeping a Goldilocks economy within reach. ""Too much inflation in the mix risks the economy getting too hot, leading prices to spiral upwards. If rates are pushed up rapidly, there's a risk it gets too cold, freezing off economic growth. A 2% inflation target is considered just right, as long as the economy also keeps growing."" In equity markets, miners were under the cosh as metals prices fell, with Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo American and Glencore all lower. British Airways and Iberia owner IAG flew lower after a downgrade to 'hold' from 'buy' at Peel Hunt. The broker said IAG's yields are unlikely to rise quickly enough to offset fuel cost pressures. Online review website Trustpilot tumbled after shareholders placed around 41 million shares, or a 10% stake, in the company. According to Bloomberg, holders Draper Esprit, Index Ventures, Northzone, Seed Capital, Sunley House Capital Management and Vitruvian Partners placed the shares. Hammerson was in the red even as the property group reported a ""significant"" improvement in rent collection for the fourth quarter.

"TOP NEWS: Burberry ""delighted"" to hire Versace's Akeroyd as new CEO"¬"(Alliance News) - Burberry Group PLC named Gianni Versace SpA's Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive on Wednesday. Investors cheered the move, with Akeroyd credited by Burberry as ""reorganising and accelerating growth"" at Italian fashion house Versace. Shares in the FTSE 100-listed luxury fashion brand were 1.0% higher in London on Wednesday morning at 1,848.50 pence each - making it one of the best performers in the blue-chip index. He was previously CEO of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen. Burberry said he ""led a turnaround of the British luxury brand and laid the foundation for global expansion"". Burberry's current CEO Marco Gobbetti will leave the fashion house at the end of 2021, with Akeroyd taking up the role on April 1, 2022. In the meantime, Chair Gerry Murphy will chair the executive committee. Murphy said: ""I am delighted that Jonathan Akeroyd will be joining Burberry as our next chief executive officer. ""Jonathan is an experienced leader with a strong track record in building global luxury fashion brands and driving profitable growth. He shares our values and our ambition to build on Burberry's unique British creative heritage and his deep luxury and fashion industry expertise will be key to advancing the next phase of Burberry's evolution."" Akeroyd added: ""I have long admired Burberry's position as the most iconic British luxury brand and I have a deep affection for its storied heritage.

TOP NEWS: Anglo American's De Beers sales up as demand stays robust¬"(Alliance News) - Anglo American PLC's diamond business De Beers on Wednesday reported a rise in sales as demand remained robust ahead of the Diwali holiday in India. Rough diamond sales value for the provisional eighth sales cycle, which covers the period between October 4 and October 19, rose to USD490 million, up 4.9% from USD467 million in a similar sales cycle last year. But this was down 6.1% from the seventh sales cycle, which had run from August 23 to September 7, and secured USD522 million in sales. ""Owing to the restrictions on the movement of people and products in various jurisdictions around the globe, De Beers Group has continued to implement a more flexible approach to rough diamond sales during the eighth sales cycle of 2021, with the sight event extended beyond its normal week-long duration,"" said Anglo American. Anglo American is a FTSE 100 mining company focused on diamonds, copper and platinum, and owns 85% of rough diamond dealer De Beers. ""As the diamond sector prepares for the key holiday season and US consumer demand for diamond jewellery continues to perform strongly, we saw further robust demand for rough diamonds in the eighth sales cycle of the year ahead of the Diwali holiday when demand for rough diamonds is likely to be affected by the closure of polishing factories in India,"" said De Beers Chief Executive Bruce Cleaver. Anglo American shares were down 0.9% at 2,813.00 pence in London early Wednesday. In Johannesburg, they were down 0.7% at ZAR562.72.

LIVE MARKETS-S&P 500, Nasdaq make it 5-straight days of gains¬"* Major U.S. indexes gain; NYFANG outperforms * Healthcare leads major S&P sector gainers; cons disc sole loser * Dollar down; gold, crude, bitcoin rise * U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield ~1.64% Oct 19 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com S&P 500, NASDAQ MAKE IT 5-STRAIGHT DAYS OF GAINS (1605 EDT/2005 GMT) Amid optimism over earnings, major U.S. indexes forged higher on Tuesday. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Nasdaq 100 , S&P 500 tech sector, and NYSE FANG+TM index all advanced for a fifth-straight day. The NYFANG posted a record-high close. That said, with 10 of 11 major S&P 500 sectors higher on the day, value actually slightly outperformed growth. Of note, the main Nasdaq indexes , as well as CME e-mini Nasdaq 100 futures, spent much of the regular trading day, battling a key Fibonacci retracement zone. Here's today's IXIC trading with 10-minute bars: Traders will look for Wednesday's action to see the Fibonacci range resolved. Meanwhile, at 1.6440%, the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield hit a five-month high. Here is Tuesday's closing snapshot: (Terence Gabriel) ***** IPO TRICK OR TREAT (1345 EDT/1745 GMT) There's no slowdown in sight for the IPO market as 18 companies hope to go public before Halloween. Choppy aftermarket deal performance, however, has spooked investors. Several firms bagged their listing plans recently, , including Peloton rival iFIT Health & Fitness. Even the offering for accounts payable automation software firm AvidXchange, which appeared headed for a sweet outcome, failed to pay off for the IPO investors. AVDX shares are still trading about 4% below their issue price on Tuesday. This backdrop certainly sets up a buyers' market for new issues. Below is the current roster of IPO candidates, by anticipated debut date and approximate deal size: Oct 20: Stronghold Digital Mining (cryptocurrency) ($100m) Oct 21: Enfusion (financial software) ($300m) P10 (asset management) ($300m) Portillo’s (casual restaurants) ($375m) Runway Growth Finance (BDC) ($100m) Ventyx Biosciences (biotech) ($125m) Vita Coco (beverages) ($225m) Winc (direct-to-consumer winemaker) ($75m) Oct 22: Aris Water (frack-water recycling) ($300m) Minerva Surgical (medical devices) ($100m) Xilio Therapeutics (biotech) ($125m) Oct 27: Informatica (software) ($900m) Rent the Runway (direct-to-consumer clothing) ($300m) Arteris (semiconductors) ($75m) Oct 28: Candela Medical (medtech) ($250m) Ensemble Health (healthcare software) ($600m) Fluence Energy (alt energy) ($700m) GlobalFoundries (semiconductors) ($2.5b) (Lance Tupper) ***** CREDIT SPREADS AND THE THREE BEAR FLATTENER PROBLEMS (1236 EDT/1636 GMT) A recent sharp bear flattener move in the U.S. Treasury yield curve poses at least three problems for corporate bond credit spreads that could lead to widening for investment-grade debt and underperformance in the belly of the spread curve, according to a BofA Global Research report this week. The yield curve move, which resulted from market pricing for an earlier start to Federal Reserve rate hikes, ""reduces incentives for fixed-income investors to move out the curve, both into credit and out the maturity curve within credit,"" BofA credit strategists wrote. Secondly, a flatter yield curve makes U.S. corporate bonds less attractive on a dollar-hedged basis for foreign investors unless other yield curves flatten globally to the same extent, they added. ""The third problem with a bear flattener is the risk of sizable outflows in the belly of the curve as, unlike in the front and back ends, there would be little natural buying on weakness and thus the potential for sizable spread widening,"" the report said. Here is a chart of the U.S. 30-Year Treasury - U.S. 5-year Treasury yield spread: (Karen Pierog) ***** CHANGES COMING TO THE GICS? (1215 EDT/1615 GMT) S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc announced late Monday they have begun a consultation with members of the investment community on potential changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure. The GICS was developed in 1999 and is a four-tiered classification system comprised of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries, with each company assigned a single GICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity The consultation period began on Oct. 18 and is scheduled to end on Dec. 20. S&P and MSCI said they would announce any changes to the GICS structure by February 2022, although the consultation ""may or may not result in any changes."" The most recent reshuffle of the GICS came in September 2018, with the creation of the communication services sector https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-gics/a-close-up-of-wall-sts-new-sp-500-communication-services-sector-idUSL2N1W61WT that siphoned off names such as Facebook and Alphabet from the tech sector and Netflix from the consumer discretionary sector. Current topics up for consideration would affect the energy sector, the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors, as well as the tech and industrials sectors. Also up for discussion are classifications for banks, REITs, transportation and the definition of pharmaceuticals for cannabis inclusion. Below is a summary of potential changes, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices: (Chuck Mikolajczak) ***** FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT ON EARNINGS (1108 EDT/1508 GMT) While estimate-beating big bank third quarter profits sent stocks higher last week, Nuveen said it's approaching the rest of the earnings season ""with a degree of caution."" In a report this week, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, said that factors such as COVID-19's Delta variant, supply chains, inflation, and the end of federal stimulus, will likely keep third quarter earnings growth rates for S&P 500 companies in the 30% to 35% range, down from the first quarter when they eventually topped 50%. ""In fact, earnings revisions for the third quarter are the lowest of 2021 so far, with estimates increasing by a modest 3%-4% since the end of June, versus double-digit percentage increases in the previous two quarters,"" the report said. ""Guidance has been more moderate, too; nearly half of companies reporting so far have issued negative (earnings per share) guidance."" Still, Nuveen noted that trailing and forward-looking valuations for the S&P 500 have fallen 10% to 20% from first quarter levels, which should allow equities to grind higher even in the face of decelerating earnings growth. ""The best-positioned companies are those that can build inventories and protect/grow their margins until the headwinds created by inflation and global supply chain disruptions begin to dissipate,"" it added. (Karen Pierog) ***** MMM INFLATION (1025 EDT/1425 GMT) 'Mmm Danone' has long been the ending note of TV commercials for the French consumer group's yoghurts, but today it has somewhat of a sour ring to it. Danone shares have been in a downward trend all session, and are now falling about 3%, the worst performance of the blue chips which make the EURO STOXX 50 index. The group's Q3 earnings themselves - the group stuck to its 2021 guidance - don't seem so much to blame for the poor performance. ""It's the comments about the inflation and the supply chain"", argued Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition. CFO Juergen Esser told analysts in a conference call that inflation costs were expected to rise at least 8% in 2022 and said shipping in Asia was under high tension. But inflation is also seen impacting the price of milk, ingredients and packaging. While many strategists are trying to shift their portfolios toward assets like commodities or financials stocks which typically thrive when prices rise, Danone seems to be battling precisely on the front line of inflation, perhaps not the most comfortable place to be. As Citi analysts point out in their rating about Danone, some of the risks to their target price of 66 euros lays in ""the wholesale price of milk, as dairy inputs equal about 15% of sales"". Price of PET resin, which is used to make containers for food and drinks, is also an important cost.

With their early gains, JNJ and TRV are responsible for almost half of the DJI's early rise. Meanwhile, the NYSE FANG+TM index has hit a fresh record high, and is on track to rise for a 5th-straight day. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Nasdaq Composite are also on track for a fifth-straight day of gains. Meanwhile, the first U.S. bitcoin futures ETF is rising slightly in its market debut. Bitcoin is up around 1%. Here is your early U.S-trade snapshot: (Terence Gabriel) ***** NASDAQ 100 FUTURES: WIN STREAK MAY BE STRETCHING IT (0900 EDT/1300 GMT) CME e-mini Nasdaq 100 futures are quoted up in premarket trade, putting them on pace for a 5th-straight day of gains. That said, over the past three months, multi-day winning streaks have led to sudden setbacks: From late-July into early-October, NQcv1 has struggled in the wake of a three-to-five-day run of gains. There have been six such streaks over this period, and on average, NQcv1 then sold off nearly 3% over the next four trading days or so. NQcv1 last rose more than five-straight days with a seven-day win streak in mid-June. The futures are also rapidly nearing resistance hurdles in the form of the 76.4%/78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Sept. 7-Oct. 4 decline, in the 15,386.54/15,415.88 area, and the Sept. 27 high, at 15,399.25. This resistance should provide an interesting test for the futures, especially given the current win streak, and that the Nasdaq has been relying on its largest caps to underpin gains. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures are also on track for a 5th-straight day of gains. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 index, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE FANG+TM Index have all risen four-straight days.

Real Good Food sees revenue pick-up across markets¬"(Sharecast News) - Real Good Food said in a trading update on Wednesday that it had seen a pick-up in revenues across each of its markets in the year-to-date. The AIM-traded firm said that for the first six months ended 30 September, revenues were 30.8% ahead of the same period last year, and 0.7% above the same period before the pandemic in 2019. Sales to UK retailers were performing ""particularly well"", with growth of 12.9% over last year and 3.7% on 2019. Unaudited EBITDA for the first half was £0.5m, swinging from EBITDA losses of £1.4m last year and £0.2m in 2019, respectively. The board said that reflected the company's actions to increase margins within each business unit, although margins were being affected by surcharges on freight and transport, which were currently expected to represent a drag of around £0.3m on the year's profitability. Real Good Food said the biggest impact of the logistics challenges, coupled with ongoing staff absence rates from Covid-19, was on order fulfilment and on-time delivery, which was an issue shared across the industry and supply chain. New product innovation was described by the directors as a ""key driver"" of performance and increasing profitability. Revenue for the six months ended 30 September included 39 new products, with sales of £0.5m, or £1.4m on an annualised basis. ""We have made a good start to the year, and the group is well positioned for the seasonally busier second half of the year,"" said executive chairman Mike Holt. ""It is pleasing to see the turnaround activities within JF Renshaw gaining traction, particularly in new product innovation. ""Renshaw has regained its reputation as the product innovator and first choice supplier of quality products, both branded and private label.""

UPDATE 3-Soccer-Bruce leaves role as Newcastle boss after Saudi-led takeover of club¬"(Adds reaction) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bruce has left his position as Newcastle United manager by mutual consent, the Premier League team said in a statement on Wednesday, two weeks after they were taken over by a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium. Bruce had appeared to be on borrowed time after the Premier League announced earlier this month that Newcastle had been sold to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The 60-year-old had said following the change of ownership that he would understand if he was replaced but he was allowed to take charge of the 1,000th match in his managerial career when Newcastle hosted Tottenham Hotspur in the league, losing 3-2 last Sunday. The signs were ominous, however, with Newcastle's new director Amanda Staveley saying ""change does not always happen overnight"". ""I'm grateful to everyone connected with Newcastle United for the opportunity to manage this unique football club,"" Bruce said in a club statement. ""I would like to thank my coaching team, the players and the support staff in particular for all their hard work. There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts. ""This is a club with incredible support, and I hope the new owners can take it forward to where we all want it to be. I wish everyone the very best of luck for the rest of this season and beyond."" Newcastle said Bruce's assistant Graeme Jones will lead the team on an interim basis, starting with Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace, and will be supported by the coaching team of Steve Agnew, Stephen Clemence, Ben Dawson and Simon Smith. Sky Sports reported that former AS Roma manager Paulo Fonseca, who was on the radar of Tottenham Hotspur earlier this year, was among a number of contenders for the job. Newcastle's defeat by Spurs, attended by Staveley and others on the board, spoiled the takeover celebrations at St James' Park, with fans also calling for Bruce to be sacked as Newcastle slipped to their fifth league loss of the campaign. Bruce, who was appointed Newcastle manager in July 2019, was already on thin ice after a dismal start to the campaign that leaves the club languishing second-from-bottom in the league without a win after eight games. Bruce, a lifelong Newcastle fan, was an unpopular choice for some supporters following his appointment after Spaniard Rafa Benitez left the club and said he was pained by the criticism and abuse he received. He guided Newcastle to 13th and 12th-placed finishes in the league and helped them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and the League Cup. ""I know how tough it was for any manager at Newcastle for the last 14 years,"" club great Alan Shearer tweeted. ""I also know how badly Steve and his family wanted it to work. ""In difficult circumstances for everybody, he kept #NUFC up for two seasons. It's a new era now, but thank you, Steve, for your effort and commitment.""

"Segro says ""successful"" third quarter gives confidence for fourth"¬"Alliance News) - Segro PLC said Wednesday it has had a ""successful"" third quarter, making ""significant progress"" on its profit development. In the third quarter, Segro signed GBP26 million of new headline rent, up from GBP16 million a year before, taking the total to GBP64 million for the nine months to September 30, increased from GBP50 million last year. The quarterly vacancy rate reduced to 3.2% from 4.3%, with Segro attributing this to demand for speculatively developed space. Chief Executive David Sleath said: ""Segro has had an active and successful third quarter as we continue to capitalise on strong occupier and investment market conditions, with high leasing volumes across the business."" ""We have made significant progress with our profitable development programme and have completed projects equivalent to GBP25 million of potential rent, of which over 90% is already let. We currently have 1 million square meters of space under construction, and during the period have added to the active pipeline and secured further land to extend our bank of future development opportunities,"" he added. Segro said its development programme has set up the company to increase annualised rent roll by 20%, or GBP92 million, from its pipeline of assets under construction. So far in 2021, it has completed 450,000 square metres of new developments, down from 695,800 the year before, which Segro said will generate GBP25 million of headline rent with 93% already let. At the end of September, over 998,000 square metres of space was under construction, with Segro noting this could turn into GBP68 million of future headline rent. ""We head into the final months of 2021 with confidence in our ability to drive further sustainable growth in rental income, earnings and dividends,"" Sleath added. In 2021 so far, Segro has acquired over GBP260 million of land to top up its land bank, with GBP66 million added in the third quarter.

UK net zero targets at risk from inequality, says L&G¬"By Muvija M Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain's plans to hit net-zero emissions risk being derailed by income inequality, with only higher income households able to afford new green technologies unless costs are shared, financial services provider Legal & General said on Wednesday. Its research, published less than two weeks before the COP26 U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, said the average UK household has a funding gap of over 4,000 pounds ($5,500) on the installation of solar panels. The funding gap on installing a ground source heat was nearly 15,000. Households making less than 20,000 pounds a year were particularly slow to adopt green tech, the report found. ""Currently, the UK runs the risk of creating two visions of Britain: one where more affluent communities benefit from the green and clean technologies of the 21st century, and another where less affluent communities do not. Climate transition cannot be restricted to the better off,"" Legal & General CEO Nigel Wilson said. ""If the UK is to successfully hit its carbon neutral target by 2050, this transition needs to take place in a socially inclusive manner."" The research showed consumers were open to making green modifications to their homes, with 52% very or fairly willing to install solar panels and 54% happy to install a ground source heat pump. But households were willing or able to contribute just 13% of the costs associated with installing solar panels and 10% of the costs of installing a ground source heat pump, it found. To fill that funding gap, costs needed to be shared between households, local authorities and central government, Wilson said. ""We cannot build healthy and prosperous communities without building and retrofitting infrastructure which reduces emissions, improves air quality and access to green jobs,"" he added.

UPDATE 1-Lawmakers probe timeline of NatWest money laundering investigation¬"(Adds FCA comment) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British lawmakers have asked the Financial Conduct Authority why it took five years to prosecute NatWest for failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds ($551.28 million), after the lender pled guilty earlier this month. The bank on Oct. 7 admitted three criminal charges of not adequately monitoring customer accounts between 2012 and 2016, the first time a bank in Britain acknowledged it committed a criminal offence of this kind. ""There are questions which remain to be answered, most notably why it has taken five years after the police raid in 2016 to bring this case to a successful conclusion,"" Mel Stride, chair of the cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said in a letter to the FCA published on Wednesday. ""We’ve received the letter and will be responding shortly,"" a spokesperson for the FCA said. Stride said the committee is also looking into why no individual NatWest staff were prosecuted. The FCA in the case alleged NatWest had failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash. NatWest could face a potential penalty https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/natwest-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-offences-2021-10-07 of around 340 million pounds under sentencing guidelines, although a judge will set the level of any fine later this year.

CORRECT: BHP outbids Wyloo with increased offer for Noront Resources¬"(Correcting the day on which BHP increased its offer to Wednesday from Monday.) (Alliance News) - BHP Group PLC on Wednesday increased its cash offer for Noront Resources Ltd as the global mining heavyweight ups the ante in a bidding war with Australian miner Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd. Noront is a Canadian mining company, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. It is focused on the development of its Eagle's Nest nickel, copper, platinum and palladium deposit as well as chromite deposits located in the James Bay Lowlands of Ontario in an emerging metals camp known as the Ring of Fire. BHP increased its offer to CAD0.75 per share, up from its original offer of CAD0.55 made in late July, and besting Wyloo's updated CAD0.70 offer made at the end of August. Wyloo first made an offer for Noront in May for CAD0.315 per share. BHP's new offer is more than triple Noront's share price of CAD0.24 on May 21, which was the day before Wyloo made its first offer, sending the stock higher. Noront shares ended marginally lower at CAD0.78 on Tuesday in Toronto, with a market capitalisation of CAD436.1 million, around USD353.1 million. Noront supports BHP's improved offer and recommends shareholders tender now to receive the cash consideration offered before its expiry date on November 9. BHP Chief Development Officer, Johan van Jaarsveld, said: ""Our increased offer of CAD0.75 per share provides a compelling premium for Noront shareholders and is available to shareholders now. Our offer provides shareholders with the value inherent in Noront's portfolio of projects, including the Eagle's Nest project, delivering shareholders who accept our offer certainty of value and immediate liquidity."" BHP noted that delivering Noront's portfolio of projects in the Ring of Fire is expected to take many years, require significant capital investment and development of remote infrastructure.

TOP NEWS: Avast keeps guidance as billings grow ahead of US takeover¬"(Alliance News) - Cybersecurity firm Avast PLC on Wednesday backed its outlook as it reported third-quarter earnings growth ahead of the Prague-based firm's acquisition by US peer NortonLifelock Inc. Revenue for the three months to September 30 rose 3.0% to USD232.7 million from GBP226.0 million posted for the third quarter of 2020, and was up 5.6% on an organic basis. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation edged up 0.8% year-on-year to USD127.0 million. ""Billings growth accelerated through the quarter, and we expect second-half billings growth of mid to high single digits,"" the company said.

SigmaRoc says strong trading continues through third quarter¬"(Sharecast News) - Buy-and-build construction materials company SigmaRoc said on Wednesday that the strong trading performance it reported in the first half had continued through the third quarter, as it generated revenues of £73m in the three months ended 30 September. The AIM-traded firm said sustained demand across its range of geographical and product markets, as well as its management of a ""challenging"" supply chain environment, resulted in all platforms delivering a third quarter in line with management expectations. In addition, following receipt of regulatory clearances in Poland, it completed its acquisition of Nordkalk on 31 August. The integration of Nordkalk was said to be progressing well, with the business trading as expected through the period. SigmaRoc said demand in the third quarter for precast products in the UK and aggregates, concrete and dimension stone in the Benelux market continued the positive trend seen in the first half. In Jersey, planning permission was granted to allow a large extension to the Ronez quarry, and in South Wales, margins were continuing to improve as a result of the ongoing review of efficiencies. Recent and ongoing increases in energy costs were being seen across all industries, and the availability of haulage and transport was also presenting challenges, particularly in the UK. The company said it was keeping those challenges constantly under review, with steps taken to mitigate them, including the strategic fixing of certain hydrocarbon costs, ongoing business reviews to optimise production and efficiency, price increases where necessary, the sourcing of additional haulage, as well as investing in its own heavy goods vehicles and drivers. SigmaRoc said the outlook for the rest of the year remained positive, with the sustained demand seen across its businesses expected to continue into the final quarter. Supply chain and inflationary pressures were being managed effectively, with the benefit of the group's diversified platform model enabling local market-specific plans to be implemented. ""The third quarter has delivered solid results, building on our momentum from the first half of the year,"" said chief executive officer Max Vermorken. ""We have delivered a transformational acquisition with Nordkalk and this is already beginning to deliver significant earnings growth and cash generation. ""The group is well positioned to continue its strong performance and to develop future opportunities.""

TOP NEWS: Antofagasta down after guiding lower copper output next year¬"(Alliance News) - Chilean miner Antofagasta PLC on Wednesday backed its 2021 copper production guidance, but moderated warned output is set to dip next year. Shares in Antofagasta were trading down 4.5% at 1,410.00 pence each in London on Wednesday morning. In the third quarter ended September 30, copper output reached 181,100 tonnes, up 1.5% from 178,400 tonnes in the previous quarter. Higher output reflected increased production at Centinela, offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres, the company said. Cash costs before by-product credits in the third quarter were USD1.79 per pound, being 2 cents higher than the second quarter as the energy crisis pushed up input prices. Net cash costs, meanwhile, were USD1.16 per pound in the third quarter, 2.7% higher quarter-on-quarter from USD1.13 per pound. In the nine months to September 30, net cash costs averaged USD1.15 per pound, up 0.9% year-on-year from USD1.14 for each pound. ""Despite input cost pressures, our net cash costs are now expected to be lower than our original guidance of USD1.25 per pound [for the full-year],"" the miner said. Antofagasta maintained its full-year copper production guidance of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes. For 2022, however, it now expects slightly lower output of between 660,000 and 690,000 tonnes.

London pre-open: Stocks seen up as investors mull inflation data¬"(Sharecast News) - London stocks were set to rise at the open on Wednesday as investors mull the latest UK inflation figures. The FTSE 100 was called to open 10 points higher at 7,227. CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said: ""After the pullbacks seen on Monday, we managed a rather tepid rebound for European stocks yesterday, as caution about the economic outlook continued to temper sentiment. ""There was no such caution amongst US investors with markets there closing higher for the fifth day in a row, and the S&P500 back above the 4,500 level, as company earnings continued to beat expectations."" Figures released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed that consumer price inflation unexpectedly dipped to 3.1% in September from 3.2% in August. However, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%. ONS Head of Prices Mike Hardie said: ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out,' which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" In corporate news, cybersecurity firm Avast reported a rise in third-quarter revenues and reaffirmed growth guidance driven by its core direct-to-consumer business. Revenue of $232.7m was up by 5.6% on an organic basis and 3.0% at actual exchange rates for the three months to September 30. Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.8% to $127.0m. Avast reaffirmed its full-year outlook for revenue to be at the upper end of 6-8% growth, and a broadly flat adjusted EBITDA margin percentage."¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 07:37¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/london-pre-open-stocks-seen-up-as-investors-mull-inflation-data-3wtv9q2e4xplrds.html

LIVE MARKETS-Credit spreads and the three bear flattener problems¬"* Major U.S. equity indexes gain; Nasdaq out front * Healthcare leads major S&P sector gainers; staples weakest group * Dollar down; gold, crude, bitcoin rise * U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield ~1.63% Oct 19 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com CREDIT SPREADS AND THE THREE BEAR FLATTENER PROBLEMS (1236 EDT/1636 GMT) A recent sharp bear flattener move in the U.S. Treasury yield curve poses at least three problems for corporate bond credit spreads that could lead to widening for investment-grade debt and underperformance in the belly of the spread curve, according to a BofA Global Research report this week. The yield curve move, which resulted from market pricing for an earlier start to Federal Reserve rate hikes, ""reduces incentives for fixed-income investors to move out the curve, both into credit and out the maturity curve within credit,"" BofA credit strategists wrote. Secondly, a flatter yield curve makes U.S. corporate bonds less attractive on a dollar-hedged basis for foreign investors unless other yield curves flatten globally to the same extent, they added. ""The third problem with a bear flattener is the risk of sizable outflows in the belly of the curve as, unlike in the front and back ends, there would be little natural buying on weakness and thus the potential for sizable spread widening,"" the report said. Here is a chart of the U.S. 30-Year Treasury - U.S. 5-year Treasury yield spread: (Karen Pierog) ***** CHANGES COMING TO THE GICS? (1215 EDT/1615 GMT) S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc announced late Monday they have begun a consultation with members of the investment community on potential changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure. The GICS was developed in 1999 and is a four-tiered classification system comprised of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries, with each company assigned a single GICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity The consultation period began on Oct. 18 and is scheduled to end on Dec. 20. S&P and MSCI said they would announce any changes to the GICS structure by February 2022, although the consultation ""may or may not result in any changes."" The most recent reshuffle of the GICS came in September 2018, with the creation of the communication services sector https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-gics/a-close-up-of-wall-sts-new-sp-500-communication-services-sector-idUSL2N1W61WT that siphoned off names such as Facebook and Alphabet from the tech sector and Netflix from the consumer discretionary sector. Current topics up for consideration would affect the energy sector, the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors, as well as the tech and industrials sectors. Also up for discussion are classifications for banks, REITs, transportation and the definition of pharmaceuticals for cannabis inclusion. Below is a summary of potential changes, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices: (Chuck Mikolajczak) ***** FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT ON EARNINGS (1108 EDT/1508 GMT) While estimate-beating big bank third quarter profits sent stocks higher last week, Nuveen said it's approaching the rest of the earnings season ""with a degree of caution."" In a report this week, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, said that factors such as COVID-19's Delta variant, supply chains, inflation, and the end of federal stimulus, will likely keep third quarter earnings growth rates for S&P 500 companies in the 30% to 35% range, down from the first quarter when they eventually topped 50%. ""In fact, earnings revisions for the third quarter are the lowest of 2021 so far, with estimates increasing by a modest 3%-4% since the end of June, versus double-digit percentage increases in the previous two quarters,"" the report said. ""Guidance has been more moderate, too; nearly half of companies reporting so far have issued negative (earnings per share) guidance."" Still, Nuveen noted that trailing and forward-looking valuations for the S&P 500 have fallen 10% to 20% from first quarter levels, which should allow equities to grind higher even in the face of decelerating earnings growth. ""The best-positioned companies are those that can build inventories and protect/grow their margins until the headwinds created by inflation and global supply chain disruptions begin to dissipate,"" it added. (Karen Pierog) ***** MMM INFLATION (1025 EDT/1425 GMT) 'Mmm Danone' has long been the ending note of TV commercials for the French consumer group's yoghurts, but today it has somewhat of a sour ring to it. Danone shares have been in a downward trend all session, and are now falling about 3%, the worst performance of the blue chips which make the EURO STOXX 50 index. The group's Q3 earnings themselves - the group stuck to its 2021 guidance - don't seem so much to blame for the poor performance. ""It's the comments about the inflation and the supply chain"", argued Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition. CFO Juergen Esser told analysts in a conference call that inflation costs were expected to rise at least 8% in 2022 and said shipping in Asia was under high tension. But inflation is also seen impacting the price of milk, ingredients and packaging. While many strategists are trying to shift their portfolios toward assets like commodities or financials stocks which typically thrive when prices rise, Danone seems to be battling precisely on the front line of inflation, perhaps not the most comfortable place to be. As Citi analysts point out in their rating about Danone, some of the risks to their target price of 66 euros lays in ""the wholesale price of milk, as dairy inputs equal about 15% of sales"". Price of PET resin, which is used to make containers for food and drinks, is also an important cost.

That said, over the past three months, multi-day winning streaks have led to sudden setbacks: From late-July into early-October, NQcv1 has struggled in the wake of a three-to-five-day run of gains. There have been six such streaks over this period, and on average, NQcv1 then sold off nearly 3% over the next four trading days or so. NQcv1 last rose more than five-straight days with a seven-day win streak in mid-June. The futures are also rapidly nearing resistance hurdles in the form of the 76.4%/78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Sept. 7-Oct. 4 decline, in the 15,386.54/15,415.88 area, and the Sept. 27 high, at 15,399.25. This resistance should provide an interesting test for the futures, especially given the current win streak, and that the Nasdaq has been relying on its largest caps to underpin gains. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures are also on track for a 5th-straight day of gains. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 index, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE FANG+TM Index have all risen four-straight days.

UPDATE 3-UK's Burberry poaches Versace boss Akeroyd as CEO¬"* UK luxury label picks Briton to succeed Marco Gobbetti * Akeroyd led McQueen turnaround before joining Versace * Burberry's shares rise 1% (Adds shares, reaction) By Sarah Young and Paul Sandle LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British fashion house Burberry named Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive officer from next April, poaching the  boss of Milan-based Gianni Versace and former Alexander McQueen head to succeed Marco Gobbetti. The 165-year-old group has been searching for a replacement for Gobbetti since June, when he announced his shock departure mid-way into a multi-year turnaround plan to take the brand further upmarket. Shares in Burberry, which have extended losses since the announcement of Gobbetti's departure and were trading 19% down on June levels, rose 1% in early trading on Wednesday. Burberry, known for its trench coats, trademark plaid and TB monogram, said Akeroyd, a 54-year-old Briton, was the right choice to build on its creative heritage. ""Jonathan is an experienced leader with a strong track record in building global luxury fashion brands and driving profitable growth,"" Burberry Chair Gerry Murphy said. Akeroyd accelerated growth during his five years at Italy's Versace, Burberry said. He oversaw the sale of the house to U.S. label Michael Kors in 2018. Versace's sales rebounded in the latest quarter reported by its renamed parent Capri Holdings, with revenue of $240 million up 158% year on year and a return to profit after the COVID-19 impact a year earlier. Before joining Versace, Akeroyd led the turnaround of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen from 2004-2016. Berenberg analysts said Akeroyd had ""lots of luxury CEO experience of leading houses - as well as brand turnarounds"". He would earn an annual salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million), plus bonuses, and would be granted cash and share payments worth about 6 million pounds for incentives he forfeits at Versace. Like other luxury brands, Burberry was hit by COVID-19, but it has recovered, driven by demand in Asia. It said in July its like-for-like sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven by new, younger fans of Riccardo Tisci, the designer who Gobbetti brought in to revitalise the brand and who investors are relieved is staying put. Gobbetti's departure was described as a personal decision to return to Italy, where he will lead the Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo. He will leave Burberry on Dec. 31. The group said Murphy would chair the executive committee for the four months until Akeroyd joins in April.

UPDATE 3-Fertiliser maker Yara warns of higher world food prices ¬"* Warns on risk of famine for most vulnerable * 40% cut in European ammonia output to continue * Q3 EBITDA ex-special items $765 mln vs forecast 738 mln * Within 1-2 months may restore about half of cut output (Recasts on interview with CEO, adds bullet points, share) By Victoria Klesty and Gwladys Fouche OSLO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Yara, one the world's largest fertiliser makers, warned on Wednesday the world faced higher food prices because of rising energy costs and that it could lead to famine for the most vulnerable. The Norwegian company, posting stronger-than-expected third-quarter profits, also said high gas costs would continue to curtail its ammonia output in Europe, which Yara cut by 40% last month. The front-month European benchmark gas price has almost quadrupled this year to record levels, amid high demand as economies recover from the pandemic and below-average gas storage levels at the start of the winter heating season. Natural gas is the most important cost input for nitrogen-based chemicals and fertilisers, including ammonia. Higher energy prices will make food more expensive as farmers face higher input costs, such as fertilisers, said Yara CEO Svein Tore Holsether. ""I am particularly worried that the most vulnerable are going to be hit again, the second shock to the food system in a very short time, after the pandemic,"" Holsether told Reuters. ""The impact will likely be that we face famine (in some places),"" he said, adding he had discussed his concerns with David Beasley, the head of the United Nations' World Food Programme, this week. Q3 BEAT July-September earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding one-off items, rose to $765 million from $558 million a year earlier and topped the $738 million expected by analysts in a Refinitiv poll. Yara said higher prices for its products more than offset lower deliveries and increased input costs. It expects to pay $850 million more for natural gas in the fourth quarter than a year earlier, and $950 million more in the first quarter of 2022 than the same period of 2021. But since Yara is cutting ammonia output in Europe, it is buying less gas and so the cost impact will depend on the duration of the curtailment. About half of the cut output could be restored ""within a month or two,"" Holsether said, as some of it was due to maintenance. The final decision would depend on natural gas prices and contract commitments, among other factors, he said. Yara has capacity to produce 8.6 million tonnes of ammonia a year across its plants annually, with more than half of this - 4.8 million tonnes - in Europe. It has an overall production capacity of just under 23 million tonnes of finished products used to fertilise crops, as well as for explosives and cleaning exhaust from diesel engines, among other applications. Shares in Yara were down 0.65% at 0945 GMT in an Oslo benchmark index down 0.2%.

GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares gain on earnings optimism¬"* Euro STOXX 600 gains 0.1% * Mixed picture for European earnings * Yen slips to 4-year low as risk sentiment improves * Bitcoin near all-time high * Oil prices near multi-year peak, China coal tumbles By Tom Wilson and Hideyuki Sano LONDON/TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Shares from Asia to Europe gained on Wednesday on rising optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, while government bond yields rose and the yen fell to its lowest in four years against the dollar. The regional Euro STOXX 600 traded up 0.1% after opening in negative territory, amid a somewhat mixed picture for earnings even as investors were largely upbeat about prospects. German stocks also turned positive, adding 0.3%. In the Netherlands, chip-making machine maker ASML Holdings , a key supplier to computer chip makers, fell 3% despite posting slightly better-than-expected quarterly results. Swiss food giant Nestle gained 3% after it raised its sales outlook. Earnings reports will be in full swings in many countries over coming weeks. Tesla is among companies that will release results later on Wednesday. ""Some volatility should be expected in a time when you have the earnings season, you have a multiplicity of shocks going through the system,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. ""The long-term outlook is actually quite good. The economies are slowing down but going quite well."" U.S. futures gauges suggested that Wall Street would open flat. MSCI's world equity index , which tracks shares in 50 countries, also traded flat. The positive mood in Asia and a day earlier in the United States nevertheless saw government bond yields rising further. Euro zone yields steadied as recent comments by European Central Bank officials failed to soothe fears of a potential monetary tightening. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield climbed at one point to as high as 1.673%, a level last seen in May. It last stood at 1.64%. Shorter yields dipped, however, with the two-year yield slipping to 0.39% from Monday's peak. ""Whilst inflation concerns are still very much bubbling under the surface of markets, risk appetite strengthened further thanks in no small part to decent earnings reports,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note. ""There are no signs of widespread erosions of margins at the moment. Perhaps there is so much money sloshing about that for now prices are broadly being passed on."" MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5%, led by 1.1% gains in Hong Kong. FED TAPERING Investors expect the Federal Reserve to announce tapering of its bond buying and money markets futures are pricing in one U.S. rate hike later next year. ""The Fed is likely to become more hawkish, probably tweaking its language on its assessment that inflation will be transient,"" said Naokazu Koshimizu, senior strategist at Nomura Securities. ""While the Fed will maintain tapering is not linked to a future rate hike, the market will likely try to price in rate hikes and flatten the yield curve."" In the currency market, a rise in long-term rates pushed the dollar to close to a four-year high against the yen. The greenback climbed as high as 114.585 yen for the first time since November 2017. Bitcoin stood at $63,937, near its all-time peak of $64,895 as the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading on Tuesday. Oil prices eased slightly but held near multi-year peaks as an energy supply crunch persisted across the globe. Brent crude futures dropped 61 cents, or 0.6%, to $84.47 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures traded at $82.33 per barrel, down 0.7% on the day but near Monday's peak of $83.18, the highest level since 2014.

London open: Stocks tread water as investors mull inflation data¬"(Sharecast News) - London stocks were little changed in early trade on Wednesday as investors mulled the latest UK inflation figures. At 0830 BST, the FTSE 100 was down 0.1% at 7,212.96, while sterling was 0.1% weaker against the dollar at 1.3784. Data released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed consumer price inflation unexpectedly dipped in September despite the rising cost of fuel and transport. CPI fell to 3.1% from 3.2% in August, versus expectations for it to remain unchanged. Still, it remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, meaning it's unlikely to do anything to reduce expectations the Bank will raise interest rates before the end of the year. The decline was due mainly to the impact of last summer's 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme. The biggest downward contribution came from restaurants/cafes inflation, which fell to 3.9% in September from 7.9% the month before. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, slipped to 2.9% from 3.1%. ONS Head of Prices Mike Hardie said: ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out,' which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflation is expected to reach 4%, double the BoE's target by the end of the year, and potentially 5% by next April. ""With prices staying stubbornly high and another surge expected, a gentle rise in interest rates before the end of the year still looks likely if there is any chance of keeping a Goldilocks economy within reach. ""Too much inflation in the mix risks the economy getting too hot, leading prices to spiral upwards. If rates are pushed up rapidly, there's a risk it gets too cold, freezing off economic growth. A 2% inflation target is considered just right, as long as the economy also keeps growing.""

AIM - WINNERS Arena Events Group PLC, up 43% at 20.30 pence, 12-month range 4.01p-21p. The firm - which services major events, supplying things such as temporary physical structures and seating - agrees to be taken over by Theta Bidco Ltd in deal worth enterprise value of GBP95.1 million. The suitor - owned by joint offerors IHC Industrial Holding LLC and Tasheel Holding Group LLC - will pay 21p per Arena share, being a 48% premium to Tuesday's closing price. It values Arena's entire issued share capital at GBP71.0 million. ""IHC and Tasheel are both diversified holding companies, formed as part of initiatives to diversify and grow non-oil business sectors in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia respectively. Arena fits well into that diversification strategy, particularly given the growth potential of the temporary events structures market in the Middle East,"" they note. Reabold Resources PLC, up 19% at 0.1845p, 12-month range 0.15p-0.87p. Notes that Corallian Energy Ltd, in which it holds just under a 50% stake, has decided to undertake review of strategic options to maximise shareholder value. This will include fielding potential takeover offers for up to 100% of the firm. ""Reabold remains supportive of Corallian, its board, and the timing of this strategic review.

UPDATE 1-UK inflation declines unexpectedly in September - ONS¬"(Adds details, background) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month but the decline probably marked a temporary respite for consumers and the Bank of England is expected to address the acceleration by raising interests rates, possibly in two weeks. Consumer prices rose 3.1% in annual terms in September, easing back from 3.2% in August, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to inflation of 3.2% in September although 11 of the 34 analysts who took part had predicted a slowing in the rate of price growth. The hospitality sector was the largest drag on inflation last month - the result of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant meal subsidy scheme launched in August 2020 dropping out of the annual comparison. Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to rise slightly above 4% in the last quarter of 2021 but since then energy prices have continued to rise sharply. On Sunday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey sent a latest signal that the British central bank was gearing up to raise rates for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus crisis as the risks from inflation mounted.

UK hits highest level of coronavirus deaths and cases in months¬"(Alliance News) - Coronavirus deaths in the UK have risen to their highest daily level since early March, while cases are at their highest for almost three months. The latest figures come as Downing Street said it is keeping a ""very close eye"" on increasing case rates and after a leading scientific advisor warned it is ""critical"" that the Covid-19 booster programme is accelerated. On Tuesday, the government said a further 223 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 138,852. While the numbers are often higher on Tuesdays because of a lag in reporting deaths and cases over the weekend, this is the highest figure for daily reported deaths since March 9. Meanwhile, the seven-day average for cases is standing at 44,145 cases per day â€“ the highest level for almost three months. The UK now has one of the highest weekly rates of new reported cases in the world. While hospital admissions and deaths in the UK are slowly creeping up, vaccines are still working well overall to prevent severe disease. Number 10 said the government was ""not complacent"" about rising coronavirus cases but added the level of hospital admissions and deaths were ""an order of magnitude lower"" compared to earlier in the pandemic. The prime minister's official spokesman said there were ""no plans"" to use the contingency measures set out in the autumn-winter strategy, and stressed that ""the most important message for the public to understand is the vital importance of the booster programme"", as well as for eligible children to come forward for a jab. Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, and a leading member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said there is a need to speed up boosters and the vaccination of teenagers, who he suggested should be given two doses of a jab to block infection and transmission. Eligible people, who had their second Covid jab at least six months ago, are now being invited for a top-up of a Pfizer Inc or Moderna Inc vaccine, as recommended by the JCVI. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government is ""ramping up"" the vaccination programme, with children aged between 12 and 15 years old able to use the national booking service to secure their Covid-19 jabs ""to make the most of half-term next week"". Ferguson, whose data was instrumental to the UK going into lockdown in March 2020, said the UK had higher Covid-19 cases than other countries for a number of reasons. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was due to a ""lower functional immunity"" in the UK population compared to most other Western European countries. He said this is down to waning immunity after a successful early vaccine rollout and a bigger reliance on the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, which he said protects very well against very severe outcomes of Covid-19 but ""protects slightly less well than Pfizer against infection and transmission, particularly in the face of the Delta variant"". He added that the UK is no longer in the top rank of European countries in terms of overall vaccination coverage, particularly in vaccinating teenagers. Just over 67% of the UK population have received two doses of vaccine according to Government figures, compared with at least 75% in Denmark, 79% in Spain and 86% in Portugal. The weekly rate of new reported cases of Covid-19 in the UK has jumped from 367 cases per 100,000 people at the start of October to its current level of 463 per 100,000. By contrast, rates have dropped to very low levels in neighbouring countries such as Spain, France and Germany. Ferguson said Covid booster jabs are ""absolutely"" the answer to waning immunity, adding that it is ""critical we accelerate the booster programme"". He said there is no reason to ""panic right now"" regarding the general situation, but repeated his belief that the administration of booster doses should be accelerated, as well as jabs for younger teenagers. The scientist said ""people need to be aware that we have currently higher levels of infection in the community than we've almost ever had during the pandemic"", amid suggestions that people have ""gone back to normal"". Ferguson said it remains ""prudent to be cautious in everyday interactions â€“ certainly wearing masks helps that, it reminds people that we're not completely out of the woods yet"". While winter might see the government's ""Plan B"" implemented and ""some rolling back of measures"", he feels it is unlikely ""we'll ever get close"" to the lockdown the country experienced in January. David King, who was the UK government's chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2007, said the Covid-19 booster rollout was going ""extremely slowly"". According to the government coronavirus dashboard, 2.3 million people in England aged 80 and over had received both doses of vaccine as of April 17 â€“ so were eligible for a booster dose as of October 17, however NHS England figures show that only 1.3 million people in England in this age range had received a booster dose as of that date. In addition, 31% of eligible 75 to 79-year-olds and 15% of 70 to 74-year-olds have had a booster so far. According to calculations from the John Roberts, from the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, which has been tracking the vaccine rollout, there are 8.5 million people in England now eligible for a booster if they want one. He said there are 4.8 million who had their second dose at least six months ago, but who have not yet received a booster. NHS England said 7.9 million people in England are eligible for a booster, of whom 5.5 million have received invitations. Some 1.9 million people will be invited this week as they have become eligible over the last few days, it added. This leaves around 500,000, which includes care home residents who are not invited through the national booking system. An NHS England spokesman said: ""Almost four million people have already received their booster in just four weeks since the rollout began â€“ more than double the rate of the initial rollout in December. ""While the NHS can only invite people to get their booster six months on from their second jab, millions of people are getting invited within days of becoming eligible and as there is plenty of capacity available. The NHS message remains that when you are invited, you should book in immediately."" source: PA Copyright 2021 Alliance News Limited.

Balfour Beatty converts revolving credit facility in sustainable loan¬"(Alliance News) - Balfour Beatty PLC on Wednesday said it has agreed on the conversion of its GBP375 million revolving credit facility to the sustainability linked loan, extending the maturity to October 2024. Under the terms of the loan, the company said it will deliver improvement in three areas: carbon emissions, social value generation, and an independent environmental, social & governance. The London-based construction company said performance in these three areas will be monitored during the lifetime of the credit facility and depending on the outcomes achieved, a credit margin reduction or increase will be applicable. ""We appreciate the support of our international bank group and the confidence this commitment reflects in Balfour Beatty,"" said Chief Financial Officer Phil Harrison. The FTSE 250 stock was trading 0.5% lower in London on Wednesday morning at 261.20 pence a share. In August, Balfour Beatty restarted interim payouts and reiterated its 2021 outlook. The company confirmed that it expects its profit from operations for earnings-based businesses in 2021 to be in line with the GBP172 million reported in 2019. The move came after Balfour Beatty posted a pretax profit of GBP35 million for the half-year ended July 2, compared to a GBP26 million loss a year before. Pretax profit, however, remained 44% below the GBP63 million reported in the same period in 2019. By Evelina Grecenko; evelinagrecenko@alliancenews.com Copyright 2021 Alliance News Limited.

UPDATE 2-Soccer-Bruce leaves role as Newcastle boss after Saudi-led takeover of club¬"(Adds details) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bruce has left his position as Newcastle United manager by mutual consent, the Premier League team said in a statement on Wednesday, two weeks after they were taken over by a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium. Bruce had appeared to be on borrowed time after the Premier League announced earlier this month that Newcastle had been sold to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The 60-year-old had said following the change of ownership that he would understand if he was replaced but he was allowed to take charge of the 1,000th match in his managerial career when Newcastle hosted Tottenham Hotspur in the league, losing 3-2 last Sunday. The signs were ominous, however, with Newcastle's new director Amanda Staveley saying ""change does not always happen overnight"". ""I'm grateful to everyone connected with Newcastle United for the opportunity to manage this unique football club,"" Bruce said in a club statement. ""I would like to thank my coaching team, the players and the support staff in particular for all their hard work. There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts. ""This is a club with incredible support, and I hope the new owners can take it forward to where we all want it to be. I wish everyone the very best of luck for the rest of this season and beyond."" Newcastle said Bruce's assistant Graeme Jones will lead the team on an interim basis, starting with Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace, and will be supported by the coaching team of Steve Agnew, Stephen Clemence, Ben Dawson and Simon Smith. Sky Sports reported that former AS Roma manager Paulo Fonseca, who was on the radar of Tottenham Hotspur earlier this year, was among a number of contenders for the job. Newcastle's defeat by Spurs, attended by Staveley and others on the board, spoiled the takeover celebrations at St James' Park, with fans also calling for Bruce to be sacked as Newcastle slipped to their fifth league loss of the campaign. The 60-year-old Bruce, who was appointed Newcastle manager in July 2019, was already on thin ice after a dismal start to the campaign that leaves the club languishing second-from-bottom in the league without a win after eight games. Bruce, a lifelong Newcastle fan, was an unpopular choice for some sections of supporters following his appointment after Spaniard Rafa Benitez left the club and had said last week that he was pained by some of the criticism and abuse he had received. He guided Newcastle to 13th and 12th-placed finishes in the league and helped them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and the League Cup.

Britain's Royal Mint to extract gold from discarded electronics¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Mint said on Wednesday it planned to build a plant in Wales that could reclaim hundreds of kilograms of gold and other precious metals from electronic waste such as mobile phones and laptops. Gold and silver are highly conductive and small quantities are embedded in circuit boards and other hardware, along with other precious metals. Most of this material is never recovered, with discarded electronics often dumped in landfill or incinerated. The more than 1,100-year old mint said it had partnered with a Canadian start-up called Excir which has developed chemical solutions to extract the metals from the circuit boards. ""It's able to selectively pull out precious metals with a high degree of purity,"" said Sean Millard, the mint's chief growth officer. He said the mint was currently using the process at small scale while designing a plant that ""would look to process hundreds of tonnes of e-waste per annum, generating hundreds of kilograms of precious metals"". The plant should be up and running ""within the next couple of years"", he said, declining to say how much it would cost. A kilogram of gold is worth around $55,000 at current prices.

Analysts divided on Bitcoin after US ETF: $70,000, $100,000 or profit-taking¬"(Sharecast News) - Bitcoin's meteoric rise to more than 40% in October, possibly leading to a record high in April, could lead to widespread profit-taking if the stock market maxim of ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"" holds true. The debut of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund represents a historical moment for the digital asset and the cryptocurrency market, and market consensus points to this fact as one of the main causes of this month's rally. The big question now is whether investors will continue to stretch the price above $65,000 or whether they will take advantage of any small bump the ProShares fund experiences to dive for profit-taking. Expectation around the debut of this investment vehicle was at its peak, as analysts claimed the milestone as a bigger trigger for the cryptoverse than the purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoins by Tesla founder Elon Musk in February. But now that the regulatory hurdle has been cleared, the focus shifts to investor reaction. In this regard, strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs is what is needed to help the queen of cryptos break the record high of around $65,000 in April. ""If traders see the exchange-traded fund's performance as promising, near-term resistance could come from the $70,000 level,"" comments Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda. Conversely, ""the low trading volumes of these vehicles could trigger a sell-off into low-margin market territory,"" he adds. However, the past behavior of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation raises fears of widespread profit-taking, whatever the ETF's outcome. When the first futures contracts saw the light of day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Dec. 17, 2017, Bitcoin reached $20,000 after a 2,000% rise during the previous two months. But it then triggered a low-margin market that lasted a year. In fact, in 2021 we are seeing homologous behavior. In addition to the aforementioned Tesla and Musk deal, the rise to an all-time high at the start of the second quarter, the debut of crypto trading platform Coinbase on the Nasdaq on April 14 spurred buying. The cryptocurrency fell to $30,000 the following month, dynamited in large part by Tesla's CEO, but also by profit-taking. However, ""all indicators seem to point to the market continuing its uptrend for the time being, at least until it hits $66,000 or $67,000, where it looks like it may encounter the first major resistance on its way to $100,000,"" states Alvaro Alcañiz Rubio, CMO and co-founder of Onyze. ""Now it's time to think about this next psychological level,"" adds Alejandro Zala, Bitpanda's country manager in Spain. ""Everything indicates that we are already in a new bullish cycle, what we do not know is its duration and its price limit,"" he declares. With a similar opinion, the panel of 50 experts consulted by Finder.com forecasts that the price will peak at $80,021 this year, before falling to $71,415 by the end of 2021. At new highs, ""many investors will likely take profits, leading to a rebound in Bitcoin's valuation,"" Alcañiz adds. Zala also warns that ""in these bullish cycles there are also corrections"". And he points out that ""when they come, you have to think about whether the fundamentals of this trend are solid or simply the result of speculation. The news of the last few weeks is very positive and seems optimistic that this cycle will be very positive"". In the event of a market correction like the one experienced between May and July, the experts consulted find it difficult to guess how far the valuation could fall. ""Everything seems to point to the fact that with each step forward that the market takes, increasingly robust supports are generated, so it is possible that certain heights will not be seen again"", concludes Alcañiz."¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 10:10¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/analysts-divided-on-bitcoin-after-us-etf-70-000-100-000-or-profit-taking-bjvhvjg82byvz24.html

UPDATE 1-Roche lifts 2021 outlook as Delta variant spurs COVID-19 test demand¬"(Adds CEO quote, details on outlook, background) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche raised its 2021 sales forecast after posting an 8% rise in nine-month revenues, powered by demand for COVID-19 tests and strength in the overall business due to newly launched diagnostics platforms and medicines. Group sales in the nine months to September rose to 46.68 billion Swiss francs ($50.54 billion) from 43.98 billion Swiss francs a year earlier, the Basel company said on Wednesday, as diagnostics division sales jumped 39%. ""The demand for coronavirus tests remained high in the third quarter due to the Delta variant,"" Chief Executive Severin Schwan said, adding that there have also been signs of recovery in the pharmaceuticals unit since the summer. Roche, which had flagged a slowdown in demand for the COVID-19 tests in the second half of the year, now expects sales to grow in the mid-single digit range at constant exchange rates. It previously expected a rise in the low to mid-single digit percentage range. A plethora of new launches, possibly including an Alzheimer's treatment if approved by U.S. authorities, are expected to bolster future sales at Roche as it faces increasing competition for older drugs. Pivotal trials for the Alzheimer's drug gantenerumab are expected to be completed in the second half next year, the company said on Wednesday.

TOP NEWS: BHP outbids Wyloo with increased offer for Noront Resources¬"(Alliance News) - BHP Group PLC on Monday increased its cash offer for Noront Resources Ltd as the global mining heavyweight ups the ante in a bidding war with Australian miner Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd. Noront is a Canadian mining company, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. It is focused on the development of its Eagle's Nest nickel, copper, platinum and palladium deposit as well as chromite deposits located in the James Bay Lowlands of Ontario in an emerging metals camp known as the Ring of Fire. BHP increased its offer to CAD0.75 per share, up from its original offer of CAD0.55 made in late July, and besting Wyloo's updated CAD0.70 offer made at the end of August. Wyloo first made an offer for Noront in May for CAD0.315 per share. BHP's new offer is more than triple Noront's share price of CAD0.24 on May 21, which was the day before Wyloo made its first offer, sending the stock higher. Noront shares ended marginally lower at CAD0.78 on Tuesday in Toronto, with a market capitalisation of CAD436.1 million, around USD353.1 million. Noront supports BHP's improved offer and recommends shareholders tender now to receive the cash consideration offered before its expiry date on November 9. BHP Chief Development Officer, Johan van Jaarsveld, said: ""Our increased offer of CAD0.75 per share provides a compelling premium for Noront shareholders and is available to shareholders now. Our offer provides shareholders with the value inherent in Noront's portfolio of projects, including the Eagle's Nest project, delivering shareholders who accept our offer certainty of value and immediate liquidity."" BHP noted that delivering Noront's portfolio of projects in the Ring of Fire is expected to take many years, require significant capital investment and development of remote infrastructure. BHP shares were down 1.3% to ZAR397.54 each in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning, and lost 2.0% in London at 1,968.00 pence each.

Inflation dips in September but remains well above BoE target¬"(Sharecast News) - UK consumer price inflation unexpectedly dipped in September despite the rising cost of fuel and transport, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Office for National Statistics. CPI fell to 3.1% from 3.2% in August, versus expectations for it to remain unchanged. Still, it remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, meaning it's unlikely to do anything to reduce expectations the Bank will raise interest rates before the end of the year. The decline was due mainly to the impact of last summer's 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme. The biggest downward contribution came from restaurants/cafes inflation, which fell to 3.9% in September from 7.9% the month before. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, fell to 2.9% from 3.1%. ONS Head of Prices Mike Hardie said: ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out,' which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""This feels a bit like the lull before the storm as the 12% rise in utility prices on 1st October will probably lift CPI inflation to around 3.8% in October. ""And we think inflation could then climb to around 5.0% in April next year due to a further rise in utility prices and the upward influence from global/domestic product shortages. With underlying wage growth and inflation expectations rising, the BoE is concerned that higher inflation will become embedded in the system. That's why it become much keener to raise interest rates."" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said inflation is expected to reach 4%, double the BoE's target by the end of the year, and potentially 5% by next April. ""With prices staying stubbornly high and another surge expected, a gentle rise in interest rates before the end of the year still looks likely if there is any chance of keeping a Goldilocks economy within reach. ""Too much inflation in the mix risks the economy getting too hot, leading prices to spiral upwards. If rates are pushed up rapidly, there's a risk it gets too cold, freezing off economic growth. A 2% inflation target is considered just right, as long as the economy also keeps growing."""¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 07:31¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/inflation-dips-in-september-but-remains-well-above-boe-target-wtacc47u4tgcrih.html
Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann to step down¬"(Sharecast News) - Germany's Central Bank said on Wednesday that President Jens Weidmann will step down at the end of December. Weidmann is leaving the Bundesbank, which he has headed since May 2011, for personal reasons. He is stepping down five years before his term was due to end. In a letter to the Bank's staff, he wrote: ""I have come to the conclusion that more than 10 years is a good measure of time to turn over a new leaf - for the Bundesbank, but also for me personally."" Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro at ING, said: ""The next hours and days might reveal whether there are any reasons related to the European Central Bank's current monetary policy stance and inflation assessment involved in Weidmann's decision."" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Clearly, the Bundesbank is still likely to be among the more 'hawkish' national central banks in the euro-zone, given Germany's traditional concerns about inflation and its position as a net creditor. ""But whereas Weidmann's Bundesbank has often been at best a reluctant supporter of the consensus, this provides an opportunity for Germany's policymakers to move further into the mainstream and perhaps to have more influence over the future direction of ECB policy - albeit only after the crucial December ECB Governing Council meeting has taken place."""¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 10:55¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/bundesbank-chief-jens-weidmann-to-step-down-cpthvl61esbtjiu.html
REPEAT: UK inflation rate eases but still well above BoE target¬"(Alliance News) -Â The annual UK inflation rate eased a touch last month, data showed on Wednesday, but still remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. Month-on-month, prices rose 0.3%, again slowing from August's 0.7% rise. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, Head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year."" The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the Financial Times. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" A separate release from the ONS showed producer price growth picked up in September. Output prices rose 6.7% on the year to September, accelerating from 6.0% in August. Input price growth also ticked up, to 11.4% from 11.2%.

FOREX-Dollar dips, while sterling, NZ dollar gain¬(Recasts with dollar move, adds Bitcoin details, updates prices) * Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Oct 19  (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed but remained lower on the day as other currencies, including sterling, were boosted by expectations of sooner-than-previously expected interest rate hikes. The greenback reached a one-year high against a basket of other currencies last week as Treasury yields surged and as investors bet the Federal Reserve may need to increase rates to address stubbornly high inflation. Yields appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, before grinding higher again, with benchmark 10-year yields reaching more than three-month highs. The dollar’s move lower on Tuesday was likely exaggerated by technical factors as investors unloaded long positions. “The movement in rates hardly explains the extent of the USD drop,” analysts at Scotiabank said in a report. “Rather, it seems USD long liquidation has snowballed into a broader clear out of positioning, triggering a technical reversal in the USD generally,” they said. The dollar also dipped after data showed that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor, supporting expectations that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday that U.S. labor shortages may outlast the coronavirus pandemic and limit overall economic growth unless the country comes up with better education, health and childcare policies to boost the number of people willing and able to work. The dollar index against a basket of other currencies was last down 0.22% on the day at 93.73, after earlier dropping to 93.50, the lowest since Sept. 28. The euro gained 0.25% to $1.1640. Currencies, including sterling and the New Zealand dollar, are benefiting from rising interest rate increase expectations. The British pound rose 0.51% to $1.3798 as money markets priced in a cumulative 35 basis points in rate hikes by the end of the year. New Zealand's dollar jumped 1.14% to $0.7159 after data on Monday showed the fastest consumer-price inflation in more than a decade. It earlier rose to $0.7172, the highest since June 11. Britain and New Zealand have led a rise in short-term bond yields, with short-dated yields climbing comparatively more than in the United States. The Aussie rose to $0.7485, the highest since July 15, shrugging off dovish minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's last meeting. The yuan hit a four-month high as fears about contagion from property giant China Evergrande's debt troubles receded and some of its peers made bond coupon payments. Policymakers said late last week the situation was controllable. The offshore yuan strengthened to as much as 6.3674 per dollar, the strongest since June 1. Bitcoin rose to $63,789 as the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading, the highest since April when it set a record high of $64,895. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 3:00PM (1900 GMT) Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct       High Bid    Low Bid Previous                   Change Session Dollar index                 93.7260        93.9360     -0.22%         4.162%        +93.9360    +93.5010 Euro/Dollar                  $1.1640        $1.1611     +0.25%         -4.73%        +$1.1670    +$1.1609 Dollar/Yen                   114.2900       114.3100    -0.03%         +10.63%       +114.3500   +113.9150 Euro/Yen                     133.04         132.71      +0.25%         +4.82%        +133.1800   +132.6300 Dollar/Swiss                 0.9225         0.9239      -0.14%         +4.28%        +0.9239     +0.9185 Sterling/Dollar              $1.3798        $1.3728     +0.51%         +1.00%        +$1.3833    +$1.3725 Dollar/Canadian              1.2358         1.2377      -0.15%         -2.94%        +1.2382     +1.2312 Aussie/Dollar                $0.7479        $0.7413     +0.90%         -2.78%        +$0.7485    +$0.7408 Euro/Swiss                   1.0738         1.0723      +0.14%         -0.64%        +1.0740     +1.0711 Euro/Sterling                0.8433         0.8456      -0.27%         -5.64%        +0.8463     +0.8424 NZ                           $0.7159        $0.7085     +1.14%         -0.22%        +$0.7172    +$0.7085 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway                8.3500         8.4230      -0.87%         -2.77%        +8.4185     +8.3325 Euro/Norway                  9.7206         9.7739      -0.55%         -7.13%        +9.7830     +9.7103 Dollar/Sweden                8.6178         8.6471      -0.26%         +5.14%        +8.6641     +8.5883 Euro/Sweden                  10.0321        10.0581     -0.26%         -0.44%        +10.0619    +10.0158 (Reporting by Karen Brettell; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Andrea Ricci)¬Tue, 19th Oct 2021 20:35¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/forex-dollar-dips-while-sterling-nz-dollar-gain-xh44tkii2zaq4lz.html
"UK must provide temporary ""safety valve"" of more EU immigration - CIPD"¬"By William Schomberg LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain should temporarily allow more young people from the European Union back into its labour markets to fix the shortage of staff facing many companies, a human resources trade body said on Wednesday. Many of the problems pre-dated the coronavirus pandemic and were therefore unlikely to be resolved once the economy returns to a more normal footing, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson this month promised to do away with what he called ""the old failed model of low wages, low skills, supported by uncontrolled immigration"", and promised a high-wage, high-productivity economy thanks to Brexit. But his government has had to offer emergency visas to EU workers to address acute shortages of truck drivers, poultry workers and butchers. The CIPD said the government should allow EU citizens to apply for Britain's youth mobility visa, which offers two-year work permits to 18-30 year-olds from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the CIPD, said research by the body showed that too many employers in low-paying sectors had focused on pushing down the cost of their workforce, rather than investing in staff to boost productivity. ""However, changes in business behaviour, people management capability and investment priorities will take time, time that firms who are struggling with acute skill and labour shortages now simply don't have,"" Davies said. ""In response, there is a strong case for an immediate immigration safety valve to address the rising labour supply challenges some employers are facing."" The CIPD also called for an overhaul of the government's apprenticeship levy to make it more flexible and for 60 million pounds ($83 million) to fund a business improvement service to help more firms invest in new technology and training.

UK monitoring 'subvariant' of Delta strain, says government¬"(Alliance News) - The UK on Tuesday said it was monitoring a subvariant of the Delta strain of the coronavirus, which has been seen in a growing number of cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the government was keeping a ""close eye"" on the AY.4.2 variant but said there was no evidence it spreads more easily. ""As you would expect, we are monitoring it closely and won't hesitate to take action if necessary,"" he told reporters. Overall infection rates in Britain remain stubbornly high, despite high rates of vaccination, and on Monday nearly 50,000 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded. Some scientists have suggested that measures to mitigate close-contact transmission, such as mask-wearing indoors, could be needed to prevent cases spiralling further. Coronavirus restrictions were lifted across the country in July after three national lockdowns. The rise has been attributed to high numbers of infections among schoolchildren, and prompted calls for a more wide-ranging booster jab programme to combat waning immunity. Downing Street has acknowledged the rising numbers of positive tests, hospital admissions and deaths, but pointed to fluctuations in all three rates in recent months. Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology at University College London, said AY.4.2 has two spike mutations found in other coronavirus variants and was first sequenced in April 2020. The subvariant was ""rare"" outside Britain and there had been only three cases detected so far in the US, he added. ""As AY.4.2 is still at fairly low frequency, a 10% increase in its transmissibility could have caused only a small number of additional cases.Â ""As such it hasn't been driving the recent increase in case numbers in the UK."" Bayroux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, added: ""This is not a situation comparable to the emergence of Alpha and Delta that were far more transmissible (50% or more) than any strain in circulation at the time.Â ""Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."" source: AFP Copyright 2021 Alliance News Limited.

TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK inflation eases but eurozone price pressure rises¬"(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday. COMPANIES Burberry named Versace's Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive. Akeroyd was credited by Burberry as ""reorganising and accelerating growth"" at Italian fashion house Versace. He was previously CEO of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen. Burberry said he ""led a turnaround of the British luxury brand and laid the foundation for global expansion"". Burberry's current CEO Marco Gobbetti will leave the fashion house at the end of 2021, with Akeroyd taking up the role on April 1, 2022. In the meantime, Chair Gerry Murphy will chair the executive committee. BHP increased its cash offer for Noront Resources as it ups the ante in a bidding war with Australian miner Wyloo Metals. Noront is a Canadian miner listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. It is focused on the development of its Eagle's Nest nickel, copper, platinum and palladium deposit as well as chromite deposits located in the James Bay Lowlands of Ontario in an emerging metals camp known as the Ring of Fire. BHP increased its offer to CAD0.75 per share, up from its original offer of CAD0.55 made in late July, and besting Wyloo's updated CAD0.70 offer made at the end of August. Wyloo first made an offer for Noront in May for CAD0.315 per share. Noront shares ended marginally lower at CAD0.78 on Tuesday in Toronto, with a market capitalisation of CAD436.1 million, around USD353.1 million. The Noront board recommended the  BHP's improved offer to shareholders. Chilean miner Antofagasta backed its 2021 copper production guidance, but moderated warned output is set to dip next year. In the third quarter ended September 30, copper output reached 181,100 tonnes, up 1.5% from 178,400 tonnes in the previous quarter. Higher output reflected increased production at Centinela, offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres. Antofagasta maintained its full-year copper production guidance of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes. For 2022, however, it now expects slightly lower output of between 660,000 and 690,000 tonnes. Anglo American's diamond business De Beers reported a rise in sales as demand remained robust ahead of the Diwali holiday in India. Rough diamond sales value for the provisional eighth sales cycle, which covers the period between October 4 and October 19, rose to USD490 million, up 4.9% from USD467 million in a similar sales cycle last year. But this was down 6.1% from the seventh sales cycle, which had run from August 23 to September 7, and secured USD522 million in sales. Rio Tinto said it is tripling its carbon emissions reduction target and is now hoping to cut those emissions by 50% by 2030. By 2025, Rio is targeting a 15% reduction in its Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions, which is five years earlier than previously. The miner noted these targets are supported by around USD7.5 billion of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030. Cybersecurity firm Avast backed its outlook as it reported third-quarter earnings growth ahead of the Prague-based firm's acquisition by US peer NortonLifelock. Revenue for the three months to September 30 rose 3.0% to USD232.7 million from GBP226.0 million posted for the third quarter of 2020, and was up 5.6% on an organic basis. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation edged up 0.8% year-on-year to USD127.0 million. ""Billings growth accelerated through the quarter, and we expect second-half billings growth of mid to high single digits,"" the company said. In August, Avast agreed to be bought by Tempe, Arizona-based NortonLifeLock in a deal worth about USD8.6 billion. It didn't provide an update on this Wednesday. Roche raised its full-year guidance as the pharmaceutical firm benefited from persistent high demand for the use of its coronavirus testing kits. The Basel, Switzerland-based company reported sales for the first nine months of the year ended September 30 of CHF46.68 billion, up 8% year-on-year from CHF43.98 billion. In the Diagnostics Division, sales grew 18% in the third quarter and 39% in the first nine months due to high demand for Covid-19 tests, a strong recovery in the base business, and Roche's newly launched diagnostics platforms. Netflix late Tuesday reported a rise in earnings and subscriber growth as the subscription-based video streaming provider hailed is hit show ""Squid Game"". For the three months to September 30, revenue was up 16% at USD7.48 billion from USD6.44 billion in the third quarter last year. Third quarter net income was up 84% at USD1.45 billion from USD790 million the year before with diluted earnings per share of USD3.19, up from USD1.74 a year ago. Further, paid memberships were up 9.4% at 213.6 million from 195.2 million the year before. The Los Gatos, California-based firm added 4.4 million memberships in the third quarter, more than the company's 3.5 million forecast, as viewers flocked to the streaming platform with the return of popular series and new hits such as ""Squid Game."" United Airlines late Tuesday reported a swing back to profit for the third quarter of 2021, on a sharp recovery in traffic, though not enough to return back to pre-pandemic levels. For the three months ended September 30, the Chicago, Illinois-based carrier swung to a net income of USD473 million from a loss of USD1.84 billion the same period a year before, while pretax profit was USD603 million, compared to a loss of USD2.33 billion. However, United Airlines' net loss for the third quarter of 2019 was USD1.02 billion. Diluted earnings per share amounted to USD1.44, swinging from a loss of USD6.33.Looking ahead, United Airlines expects capacity for the fourth quarter to be down 23% from the same period in 2019, while revenue for the period is set to suffer a 25% to 30% decline. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay USD475 million to US and British authorities to resolve charges of ""fraudulently misleading investors"" and violating anti-corruption law in the bond offerings in Mozambique, US officials announced Tuesday. Mozambique's ""hidden debt"" scandal stemmed from loans in 2013 and 2014 to three public companies to finance a tuna fishing project, debt the government masked from the nation's parliament. When details finally surfaced in 2016, donors such as the International Monetary Fund cut off financial aid, and the southern African country was plunged into a financial crisis, as it defaulted on debt payments and the currency collapsed. The transactions ""that raised over USD1 billion were used to perpetrate a hidden debt scheme, pay kickbacks to now-indicted former Credit Suisse investment bankers along with their intermediaries, and bribe corrupt Mozambique government officials,"" the US Securities & Exchange Commission said in a statement. WeWork's financial woes and aborted IPO made headlines in 2019, but two years later the office-sharing giant is returning to Wall Street after seeking to renew itself in response to the pandemic. Shareholders from a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, called BowX voted Tuesday to merge with WeWork, which will finally make the start-up a publicly-traded company. Shares of the new entity, which is worth about USD9 billion, are expected to begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. Month-on-month, prices rose 0.3%, again slowing from August's 0.7% rise. A separate release from the ONS showed producer price growth picked up in September. Output prices rose 6.7% on the year to September, accelerating from 6.0% in August. Input price growth also ticked up, to 11.4% from 11.2%. Eurozone inflation ticked up as expected last month, figures from Eurostat showed. The annual inflation rate in the bloc was 3.4% in September, picking up from 3.0% in August and confirming an earlier flash reading. The highest contribution to September's inflation rate came from energy prices, followed by services and non-energy industrial goods. Month-on-month, prices rose 0.5%, the pace nudging up from the 0.4% growth recorded for August. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol & tobacco, accelerated to 1.9% on an annual basis from 1.6% in August. German producer prices shot up in September, data from Destatis showed. Factory prices in German jumped 14% year-on-year in September. This marks the fastest annual jump since October 1974, when prices rose 15% amid the first oil crisis. Energy prices were up a third year-on-year, and by 8.0% month-on-month. The main culprit was natural gas, whose price jumped 59% on a year ago. Month-on-month, producer prices in Germany rose 2.3%, ticking up from growth of 1.5% in August and confounding expectations for a slowdown to 1.0%. Imports to Japan continued to surge in September, the Ministry of Finance reported. Imports jumped 39% to JPY7.464 trillion, about USD61 billion, from JPY5.386 trillion a year earlier. Growth was conformably above market expectations of 34% but below a 45% jump in August. Exports rose by 13% annually to JPY6.841 trillion from JPY6.054 trillion, slightly above consensus market forecasts of 11%. Japan's trade deficit stood at JPY622.76 billion - about USD5.45 billion - in September, compared to a JPY667.36 billion surplus recorded for the same month a year ago. The deficit was reduced from JPY637.2 billion in August. China's new-home prices fell for the first time in six years last month, data showed on Wednesday, as the property sector struggles after a government clampdown, while a default at several major developers added to contagion concerns from the Evergerande crisis. The latest reading follows official figures showing the real estate and construction industries shrank in the third quarter for the first time since the early stage of the pandemic, which acted as a huge drag on the world's number two economy. Figures on Wednesday showed that the cost of new homes in 70 large and medium-sized cities saw a small decrease in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said without giving a precise percentage, though Bloomberg calculations found they dropped by around 0.1%. That represents the first drop since April 2015. Prices in the secondary market slipped 0.2%, a second monthly fall, Bloomberg said. North Korea confirmed a rocket test a day earlier, saying it had tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile. North Korean state news agency KCNA reported Pyongyang test-launched a ""new type"" of rocket which it said would help enhance the country's defence technology and the navy's underwater operational capability. Photos published by KCNA showed a small rocket with a presumably small range. This, paired with the absence of leader Kim Jong Un at the launch, is why experts do not consider the test a groundbreaking development for North Korea's missile programme. US President Joe Biden was ""more confident"" about saving his multi-trillion-dollar agenda in Congress from internal party wrangling, the White House press secretary said late Tuesday, after a day of intensive negotiations with Democrats. At stake are two huge bills: an infrastructure package worth USD1.2 trillion and a second, even bigger proposal to expand the social safety net. ""After a day of constructive meetings, the president is more confident this evening about the path forward,"" said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""There was broad agreement that there is urgency in moving forward over the next several days and that the window for finalizing a package is closing,"" she added.

UK foreign minister to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British foreign minister Liz Truss will travel to Saudi Arabia and Qatar this week, seeking to further the case for a trade deal with Gulf countries and deepen diplomatic ties. Truss, formerly Britain's trade minister, will meet her Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan and Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani during the visit, the foreign office said. Earlier this month Britain took the first steps towards starting trade negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council which includes both Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Since moving to the foreign office in a reshuffle last month, Truss has tried to more closely align Britain's economic and trading ambitions with its diplomatic, defence and security agenda - seeking to maximise the country's global influence following its exit from the European Union. ""I want a closer trading and investment relationship with the Gulf and for us to collaborate more closely on issues like intelligence sharing, development, security and defence,"" Truss said.

TREASURIES-U.S. yield curve steepens as investors pare aggressive rate hike bets¬"* U.S. 10-year yield hits highest since early June * U.S. 20-year, 30-year yields touch one-week highs * U.S. 5/30 yield curve steepens to 92.8 basis points (Adds new comment, Fed's Waller's remarks, updates prices) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve widened on Tuesday, as investors unwound flattening moves of the last few sessions after global central banks dampened expectations of near-term tightening that spilled over to the world's largest bond market. The steepening of the curve extended further after weaker than-expected U.S. housing data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, meanwhile, rose to its highest in more than four months. U.S. fed fund futures, which track short-term Federal Reserve rate expectations, on Tuesday priced a 64% chance of a rate hike in July next year, down from 82% on Monday. Traders also priced a 46% chance of a U.S. rate rise by June next year, down from a more than 60% chance on Monday. The yield curve had flattened recently on expectations the Fed will tighten interest rates earlier than anticipated, pushing yields on the short end higher. The yield spread between the U.S. 5-year note and U.S. 30-year bond widened to 92.8 basis points on Tuesday. On Monday, the U.S. 5-year/30-year yield curve was at its flattest since late April 2020. ""The steepening of the curve today is a moderation of Fed hike expectations,"" said Ben Jeffery, rates strategist, at BMO Capital in New York. ""The Fed had said it will hike rates after it ends tapering but that runs counter to a June tightening that the market was pricing in. So we're probably finding a footing at a new range at this point, looking at 5s/30s between 85 and 100 basis points,"" he added. The U.S. 5-year yield, which reflects Fed tightening, has been on a tear the last two weeks, hitting its highest since February 2020 at 1.193%. The yield was last down at 1.1586%. Analysts said global central banks' dovish comments on Tuesday prompted some of the session's earlier steepening moves. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the European Central Bank's policy-setting Governing Council, said on Tuesday there is no reason for the ECB to raise rates between now and the end of 2022 as euro zone inflation is expected to fall back below the ECB's 2% target. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia, in the minutes of its October policy meeting, said the outbreak of the Delta variant had interrupted the Australian economy's recovery. It reiterated its view of no hike in the 0.1% cash rate until 2024 given sluggish wages and inflation. Aside from the dovish central bank messages, U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in September amid persistent shortages of inputs and labor. U.S. starts dropped 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.555 million units last month. The U.S. housing report briefly weighed on long-dated yields, before they resumed gains. In afternoon U.S. trading, U.S. 10-year yields were last up nearly six basis points at 1.6407%. It hit a 4-1/2-months peak of 1.6440%. U.S. 20-year and 30-year yields rose to one-week highs and were last up at 2.0684% and 2.0897%, respectively. The long end hit their peaks after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed may have to adopt ""a more aggressive policy response"" if high inflation continues through the end of the year.

UPDATE 1-U.S. says Credit Suisse to pay $475 mln to resolve Mozambican scandal charges¬(Adds details throughout) Oct 19 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay nearly $475 million to American and British authorities to resolve charges in connection with Mozambican bond offerings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday. The charges centered on the Zurich-based bank's role in a $2 billion scandal involving government-guaranteed loans. The SEC said Credit Suisse fraudulently misled investors and violated U.S. bribery laws in a scheme involving two bond offerings and a syndicated loan that raised funds on behalf of state-owned entities in Mozambique. The resolution is the latest development in the multi-year scandal for the bank. Mozambique is also suing Credit Suisse and shipbuilder Privinvest in London's High Court over $2 billion in government-guaranteed loans raised in 2013 and 2014, a hefty chunk of which went missing. A London-based subsidiary of Russian bank VTB also agreed to pay more than $6 million to settle SEC charges. Separately on Tuesday, Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA said it is concluding its enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse, saying the bank seriously violated the organizational requirements and the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) reporting obligations in connection with loans it made to state-owned companies in Mozambique in 2013.

Supply chain pressures hit earnings at Accrol¬"(Sharecast News) - Shares in Accrol Group fell sharply on Wednesday, after the tissue manufacturer warned on profits. The AIM-listed company, which makes toilet, kitchen and facial tissues, said that in common with the wider market, pressure on its raw material supply chains had been ""considerable"", with further tightening in recent weeks. In particular, it cited higher energy costs, input shortages and other ""general inflationary pressures"", alongside a lack of HGV drivers. ""While the group's supply chain has shown significant resilience and supply shortages have been managed, considerable cost increases had to be absorbed in the short term,"" Accrol noted. ""In addition, distribution pressures - notably the availability of HGV drivers, which served to increase costs further - have restricted revenue growth in the 2022 full year."" Accrol therefore anticipates 2022 full-year earnings will be be lower than previously expected, with revenue growth of around 25% and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation around 20% higher year-on-year. However, operational efficiencies, integration synergies and passing on of cost increases will mean percentage EBITDA margins should remain on par with 2021, Accrol said. As at 1245 BST, shares in Accrol were off 15% at 38.31p. Earlier in the session they had hit a multi-year low of 33.5p. Wayne Brown, analyst at Liberum, said: ""The group now expects 25% net revenue growth, and 20% adjusted EBITDA expansion in the 2022 full year, and we cut our estimates to bring them in line with guidance. ""While the group has seen very substantial cost increases over the last six months, Accrol is in a structurally much stronger position to deal with these pressure than at any time in the past."" Liberum, which is Accrol's joint broker, cut its price target on the stock to 80p from 95p, but maintained its 'buy' rating. Shore Capital, which aims to initiate formal coverage ""in the near future"", said: ""We believe the business is doing the right things in terms of mix, cost control and price recovery in markets where transparent supply constraints are proving challenging for all to manage. ""We note the current pressures but also look through the curve to a well invested and resilient everyday business with bright prospects."""¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 08:15¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/supply-chain-pressures-hit-earnings-at-accrol-2t6qehheg92j4bz.html
UPDATE 2-UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike¬"* UK inflation slips to 3.1% in Sept from 3.2% in Aug * Dip likely only a temporary respite * Bank of England gearing up to act, possibly on Nov. 4 * Hospitality drags on inflation in Sept due to base effects (Adds details) By Andy Bruce LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month but the decline was probably only a temporary respite for consumers and is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates, possibly as soon as next month. Consumer prices rose 3.1% in annual terms in September, easing back from 3.2% in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to inflation of 3.2% in September although 11 of the 34 analysts who took part predicted a slowdown. Overall, the figures did little to change expectations that the BoE will become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates, with investors increasingly betting it will do so on Nov. 4 after its next policy meeting. Yael ?Selfin, KPMG UK's chief economist, said despite the slight slowdown in inflation it had topped 3% for two months in a row, hurting the spending power of households some of whom could also face higher mortgage costs if BoE hikes rates. ""We expect further increases in inflation from October, which could reach around 4% by the end of the year, with the recent rise in wholesale energy prices passed on to households,"" Selfin said. Hospitality was the largest drag on inflation last month - the result of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant meal subsidy scheme launched in August 2020 dropping out of the annual comparisons. Prices for diners rose sharply in September last year after the scheme expired. But prices for most other consumer goods and services continued to rise, while food prices fell more slowly than in September last year. Prices of goods produced by factories rose again, led by a jump for metals and machinery as well as surging energy prices. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said. Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to rise slightly above 4% in the last quarter of 2021 but since then energy prices have continued to rise sharply. On Sunday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey sent a latest signal that the British central bank was gearing up to raise rates for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus crisis as the risks from inflation mounted.

UPDATE 1-Fertiliser-maker Yara continues to curtail ammonia output as Q3 beats forecast¬(Adds quote, detail) OSLO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Norwegian fertiliser-maker Yara posted stronger than expected third-quarter core profits on Wednesday and said high gas costs would continue to curtail the company's ammonia output. July-September earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding one-off items, rose to $765 million from $558 million a year ago, while analysts on average had expected $738 million according to a Refinitiv poll. Last month, Yara cut its ammonia output in Europe by 40% as soaring gas prices made European ammonia production unprofitable. Yara said it expected to pay $850 million more for natural gas in the fourth quarter than a year earlier, and $950 million more in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2021. However, since Yara is cutting ammonia output in Europe, it is buying less gas and so the cost impact, Yara said, would depend on the duration of the curtailments.

UPDATE 2-Britain fines Facebook $70 mln for breaching order in Giphy deal¬"(Adds reference to U.S. fine, paragraph 9) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has fined Facebook 50.5 million pounds ($69.6 million) for breaching an order imposed during its investigation into the U.S. social media giant's purchase of GIF platform Giphy, the agency said on Wednesday. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Facebook had deliberately failed to comply with its order, and the penalty served as a warning that no company was above the law. Facebook has increasingly come under fire from regulators and lawmakers about its business practices. It said it strongly disagreed with the CMA. The regulator said Facebook had failed to provide full updates about its compliance with requirements to continue to compete with Giphy and not integrate its operations with Giphy's while its investigation was ongoing. Facebook had not provided the required information, despite multiple warnings, the CMA said, and it considered its failure to comply deliberate. ""We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations,"" said Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA. ""This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law."" Bamford's words echo those of U.S. Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda on Tuesday after Facebook agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to settle civil claims over its adherence to recruitment rules. A media report on Wednesday said Facebook was planning to rebrand, a change that would likely see a parent company overseeing its brands. Responding to the CMA fine, Facebook said: ""We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. ""We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options.""

INSIGHT-AI can see through you: CEOs' language under machine microscope¬"* Natural language processing (NLP) increasingly popular * Investors seek edge in world of 'unstructured data' * But CEOs are cottoning on, with more speech scripted By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Executives, beware! You could become your own worst enemy. CEOs and other managers are increasingly under the microscope as some investors use artificial intelligence to learn and analyse their language patterns and tone, opening up a new frontier of opportunities to slip up. In late 2020, according to language pattern software specialist Evan Schnidman, some executives in the IT industry were playing down the possibility of semiconductor chip shortages while discussing supply-chain disruptions. All was fine, they said. Yet the tone of their speech showed high levels of uncertainty, according to an algorithmic analysis designed to spot hidden clues in - ideally unscripted - spoken words. ""We found that IT sector executives' tone was inconsistent with the positive textual sentiment of their remarks,"" said Schnidman, who advises two fintech companies behind the analysis. Within months of the comments, companies including Volkswagen and Ford were warning about a severe shortage of chips hitting output. Share prices in auto and industrial firms fell. IT executives now said there was a supply squeeze. Schnidman holds that computer-driven quant funds accessing scores assigned to the tone of the managers' words, versus scores assigned to the written words, would have been better positioned before the industry turmoil. One example can't testify to the accuracy of the speech analysis, though, as we don't know if the executives were being unduly optimistic at the outset or sincerely altered their views as circumstances changed. Some investors nonetheless see the technology - known as natural language processing (NLP) - as one new tool to gain an edge over rivals, according to Reuters interviews with 11 fund managers that are using or trialling such systems. They say traditional financial data and corporate statements are so heavily mined nowadays that they offer little value. 'SOMETHING VERY MESSY' NLP is a branch of AI where machine learning is let loose on language to make sense of it, and then turn it into quantifiable signals that quant funds factor into trading. The most ambitious software in this area aims to analyse the audible tones, cadence and emphases of spoken words alongside phraseology, while others look to parse the transcripts of speeches and interviews in increasingly sophisticated ways. Slavi Marinov, head of machine learning at Man AHL, part of the $135 billion investment management firm Man Group, told Reuters that NLP was ""one of the major research areas of focus"" at the computer-driven fund. ""These models transform something that is very messy to something that is easily understandable by a quant,"" he said. Indeed advocates say NLP can unlock the untapped potential for insight from the world of ""unstructured data"": the calls with analysts, the unscripted Q&As, the media interviews. This is open to debate, though. These AI systems can cost millions of dollars to develop and run, ruling out many investors and developers save the deep-pocketed or niche. Some are also at a comparatively experimental stage, with no publicly available data to show that they make money. The funds interviewed declined to show proof that NLP can augment returns, citing commercial sensitivities. Some studies suggest the techniques could boost performance if focused in smart places, though. Analysis in September by Nomura's quant strategists showed a link between the complexity of executives' language during earnings calls and shares. U.S. bosses who used simple language saw their companies' shares outperform by 6% per annum since 2014, compared with those using complex wording. BofA analysts employ a model that uses phrases in earnings calls to forecast corporate bond default rates. This examines thousands of phrases such as ""cost cutting"" and ""cash burn"" to find phrases associated with future defaults. Back-testing the model showed a high correlation with default probabilities, BofA said. Both systems analyse transcripts. MACHINE MEASURING CULTURE In years gone by, language processing in finance has featured basic and widely sold software that ranks news or social media posts by sentiment. This is losing value in the face of increasingly sophisticated NLP models, which have been spurred by tech advances and falling cloud computing costs. The breakthrough came in 2018 when developers released the source code behind NLP ""transfer learning"", which allowed a model to be pre-trained on one dataset of words and then put to work on another, saving time and money. Google's AI team has since released the code behind several cutting-edge models pre-trained on ever-larger datasets. Developers of current systems say they crunch tens of thousands of words at lightning speeds, extracting patterns and quantifying their degree of relation to certain significant ""seed"" words, phrases and ideas, as set by the user. MAN AHL's Marinov sees merit in tonal analysis but has not used it yet, focusing for now on clues hidden in written text. This can be anything from comparing annual reports over time to look for subtle changes not obvious to the reader, to quantifying something as intangible as corporate culture. Few investors have tried to formally measure corporate culture in the past even though it is critical for long-term performance, especially in the hot ESG investment sphere of environmental, social and governance considerations. Man AHL's model can scan executives' comments to look for words or phrases that demonstrate a ""goal-driven"" culture, as well searching through employee reviews on careers website Glassdoor. Kai Wu, founder of hedge fund Sparkline Capital, has created ""personality profiles"" for companies to measure their adherence to certain cultural values. He selects seed words he believes reflect such values. His NLP model then reduces vast volumes of words to small numbers of words with similar meanings, with findings expressed numerically. Using his NLP model on management commentary and employee reviews, he found that firms with ""idiosyncratic"" cultures such as Apple, Southwest Airlines and Costco outperformed. Conversely, U.S. businesses exhibiting ""toxicity"" - where employees use idioms as specific as ""good ol' boys club"" and ""dog eat dog"" - have vastly underperformed, Wu said. 'THERE ARE NO RULES' Funds without the resources to hire data scientists to build their own NLP tools can buy in analysis from third-party firms, like those Schnidman advises - fintech Aiera and tonal analytics provider Helios Life Enterprises - which sell their services to clients such as hedge funds. However, Wu at Sparkline is of the mind that funds should get NLP-derived data ""as close to raw as possible"", with in-house models preferable. The technology faces other challenges, and getting it right can be time-consuming. Dutch manager NN Investment Partners employs a mix of third-party data and its own models, some still in the research phase. One project is training a model to find words that predict bond default rates, said Sebastiaan Reinders, NNIP's head of investment science. That has initially required portfolio managers to examine long lists of phrases to manually label them as positive or negative, though. Most models are focused on English, and developers could face a difficult task adapting them to read accurately sentiment from people from different cultures who speak other languages. Plus, executives are cottoning on. When George Mussalli, chief investment officer at U.S.-based PanAgora Asset Management, told a biotech firm boss that his fund's AI scanned executives' comments for watchwords, the person asked for a list to help his business rank higher. Mussalli rejected the request but said documents like earnings call transcripts were increasingly ""well-scripted"", undermining their value. Yet Man Group's Marinov reckons executives will ultimately prove no match for machines that improve with more data. ""There are no rules, it's like a self-driving car that learns as it goes,"" he added. ""So in many cases it's impossible to give the executive a list of watchwords.""

Metro Bank sees signs of return to normality as Q3 lending flat¬"(Sharecast News) - Metro Bank said on Wednesday that it was seeing signs of a gradual return to normality as it reported flat lending for the third quarter. In the three months to the end of September, lending was steady compared to the previous quarter at £12.3bn. The bank said this reflects growth in consumer unsecured lending and specialist mortgages, offset by the attrition of lower-yielding residential mortgages and commercial term loans including the initial repayment of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. On the year, lending was down 18% after Metro sold its residential mortgage portfolio to NatWest for £3bn. Chief executive officer Daniel Frumkin said: ""The bank has continued to deliver against its strategic priorities during the quarter. We have seen improvements in our lending mix from our expanded product offering. ""We are seeing signs of a gradual return to normality and have adopted a hybrid way of working for office-based colleagues.

Deliveroo lifts outlook on strong third quarter even as lockdown eases¬"(Alliance News) - Deliveroo PLC on Wednesday raised its full-year outlook after a ""strong"" third quarter, as pandemic restrictions largely eased. Shares in Deliveroo were trading up 3.8% at 301.60 pence each in London on Wednesday morning. The food delivery company reported gross transaction value of GBP1.59 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 54% from GBP1.04 billion in the same period a year earlier. Orders were described as ""resilient"" in the quarter, jumping 64% year-on-year to 74.6 million from 45.4 million. International orders rose to 38.8 million, up 70% from 22.8 million the year prior. Meanwhile, UK orders rose 59% to 35.8 million total in the third quarter from 22.6 million in the same period during 2020, despite the easing of lockdown restrictions on restaurants and hospitality venues. Order value reduced by 6% in the third quarter, falling to GBP21.4 per order from GBP22.8 the year prior. In the first nine months of 2021, value per order fell 2% to GBP22.3 from GBP22.8 the previous year. Despite this slight drop in value per order, the significant growth in order volume and total gross value led Deliveroo to raise its full-year gross transaction value guidance once again. The company now expects gross transaction value growth of 60% to 70% in 2021, up from prior guidance of 50% to 60%, which was released in August. Margin outlook was unchanged, it said, and is still expected to be between 7.5% to 7.8% in the full year. ""While we are mindful of current and potential macroeconomic disruptions and uncertainties, we expect further strong performance in the remainder of the year and we are increasing our full-year [gross transaction value] growth guidance,"" said Founder & Chief Executive Will Shu.

(1215 EDT/1615 GMT) S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc announced late Monday they have begun a consultation with members of the investment community on potential changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure. The GICS was developed in 1999 and is a four-tiered classification system comprised of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries, with each company assigned a single GICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity The consultation period began on Oct. 18 and is scheduled to end on Dec. 20. S&P and MSCI said they would announce any changes to the GICS structure by February 2022, although the consultation ""may or may not result in any changes."" The most recent reshuffle of the GICS came in September 2018, with the creation of the communication services sector https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-gics/a-close-up-of-wall-sts-new-sp-500-communication-services-sector-idUSL2N1W61WT that siphoned off names such as Facebook and Alphabet from the tech sector and Netflix from the consumer discretionary sector. Current topics up for consideration would affect the energy sector, the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors, as well as the tech and industrials sectors. Also up for discussion are classifications for banks, REITs, transportation and the definition of pharmaceuticals for cannabis inclusion. Below is a summary of potential changes, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices: (Chuck Mikolajczak) ***** FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT ON EARNINGS (1108 EDT/1508 GMT) While estimate-beating big bank third quarter profits sent stocks higher last week, Nuveen said it's approaching the rest of the earnings season ""with a degree of caution."" In a report this week, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, said that factors such as COVID-19's Delta variant, supply chains, inflation, and the end of federal stimulus, will likely keep third quarter earnings growth rates for S&P 500 companies in the 30% to 35% range, down from the first quarter when they eventually topped 50%. ""In fact, earnings revisions for the third quarter are the lowest of 2021 so far, with estimates increasing by a modest 3%-4% since the end of June, versus double-digit percentage increases in the previous two quarters,"" the report said. ""Guidance has been more moderate, too; nearly half of companies reporting so far have issued negative (earnings per share) guidance."" Still, Nuveen noted that trailing and forward-looking valuations for the S&P 500 have fallen 10% to 20% from first quarter levels, which should allow equities to grind higher even in the face of decelerating earnings growth. ""The best-positioned companies are those that can build inventories and protect/grow their margins until the headwinds created by inflation and global supply chain disruptions begin to dissipate,"" it added. (Karen Pierog) ***** MMM INFLATION (1025 EDT/1425 GMT) 'Mmm Danone' has long been the ending note of TV commercials for the French consumer group's yoghurts, but today it has somewhat of a sour ring to it. Danone shares have been in a downward trend all session, and are now falling about 3%, the worst performance of the blue chips which make the EURO STOXX 50 index. The group's Q3 earnings themselves - the group stuck to its 2021 guidance - don't seem so much to blame for the poor performance. ""It's the comments about the inflation and the supply chain"", argued Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition. CFO Juergen Esser told analysts in a conference call that inflation costs were expected to rise at least 8% in 2022 and said shipping in Asia was under high tension. But inflation is also seen impacting the price of milk, ingredients and packaging. While many strategists are trying to shift their portfolios toward assets like commodities or financials stocks which typically thrive when prices rise, Danone seems to be battling precisely on the front line of inflation, perhaps not the most comfortable place to be. As Citi analysts point out in their rating about Danone, some of the risks to their target price of 66 euros lays in ""the wholesale price of milk, as dairy inputs equal about 15% of sales"". Price of PET resin, which is used to make containers for food and drinks, is also an important cost.

That said, over the past three months, multi-day winning streaks have led to sudden setbacks: From late-July into early-October, NQcv1 has struggled in the wake of a three-to-five-day run of gains. There have been six such streaks over this period, and on average, NQcv1 then sold off nearly 3% over the next four trading days or so. NQcv1 last rose more than five-straight days with a seven-day win streak in mid-June. The futures are also rapidly nearing resistance hurdles in the form of the 76.4%/78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Sept. 7-Oct. 4 decline, in the 15,386.54/15,415.88 area, and the Sept. 27 high, at 15,399.25. This resistance should provide an interesting test for the futures, especially given the current win streak, and that the Nasdaq has been relying on its largest caps to underpin gains. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures are also on track for a 5th-straight day of gains. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 index, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE FANG+TM Index have all risen four-straight days.

UPDATE 4-Oil falls as China considers intervention to ease coal crunch¬"* Chinese coking coal and coke futures slide * API shows higher than expected rise in U.S. crude stocks * Market eyes EIA inventory data due later on Wednesday (Updates prices, adds detail) By Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after the Chinese government stepped up efforts to tame record high coal prices and ensure coal mines operate at full capacity as Beijing moved to ease a power shortage. Brent crude futures fell 85 cents, or 1%, to $84.23 a barrel at 1217 GMT, paring a 75 cent rise in the previous session, but still lingering close to multi-year highs. November U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, which expires on Wednesday, fell 85 cents, or 1%, to $82.11 a barrel. The more active WTI contract for December was down 98 cents, or 1.2%, to $81.46 a barrel. ""China is planning to take steps to combat the steep rises in the domestic coal market ... which could put considerable pressure on the coal price there and reverse the fuel switch to oil,"" Commerzbank said. Prices for Chinese coal and other commodities slumped in early trade, which in turn pulled oil down from an uptick earlier in the day. China's National Development and Reform Commission said on Tuesday it would bring coal prices back to a reasonable range and crack down on any irregularities that disturb market order or malicious speculation on thermal coal futures. Oil markets in general remain supported on the back of a global coal and gas crunch, which has driven a switch to diesel and fuel oil for power generation. Saudi Arabia's minister of energy said users switching from gas to oil could account for demand of 500,000-600,000 barrels per day, depending on winter weather and prices of other sources of energy. But the market on Wednesday was also pressured by data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group which showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 15, according to market sources. That was well above nine analysts' forecasts for a rise of 1.9 million barrels in crude stocks, in a Reuters poll. However U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories, which include diesel, heating oil and jet fuel, fell much more than analysts had expected, pointing to strong demand. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later on Wednesday.

US close: Major indices easily reverse Monday's losses as Q3 earnings season carries on¬(Sharecast News) - Wall Street stocks closed higher on Tuesday as more big-name US companies published their latest set of quarterly results. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56% at 35,457.31, while the S&P 500 was 0.74% firmer at 4,519.63 and the Nasdaq Composite saw out the session 0.71% stronger at 15,129.09. The Dow closed 198.70 points higher on Tuesday, reversing losses registered in the previous session as elevated bond yields and a weaker-than-expected Chinese GDP print soured sentiment. Earnings were again in focus throughout the session, with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 in pre-market and also upped its full-year forecast on the back of strong adoption of its Covid-19 vaccine, while Procter & Gamble topped estimates on the back of price hikes that offset certain costs but cautioned of more inflation to come. BNY Mellon beat on third-quarter estimates thanks to improved fee income throughout the period and Halliburton reported a profit as structural global commodity tightness drove increased demand for its services, both internationally and domestically. Netflix reported after the close, publishing a solid beat on both earnings and new subscriber numbers. On the macro front, US housing starts unexpectedly dropped in September, while permits fell to twelve month low amid serious shortages of raw materials and labour, indicating yet again that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter. According to the Census Bureau, housing starts declined 1.6% month-on-month after rising 1.2% in August, while building permits slumped 7.7% in September after rising 5.6% in the prior month.

TOP NEWS: UK inflation rate eases but still well above BoE target¬"(Alliance News) -Â The annual UK inflation rate eased a touch last month, data showed on Tuesday, but still remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. Month-on-month, prices rose 0.3%, again slowing from August's 0.7% rise. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, Head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year."" The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the Financial Times. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" A separate release from the ONS showed producer price growth picked up in September. Output prices rose 6.7% on the year to September, accelerating from 6.0% in August. Input price growth also ticked up, to 11.4% from 11.2%.

UPDATE 2-UK's Burberry names Versace boss Akeroyd as CEO ¬"(Adds detail, background) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British fashion house Burberry named Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive officer from next April, poaching the  boss of Milan-based Gianni Versace and former Alexander McQueen head to succeed Marco Gobbetti. The 165-year-old group had since June been searching for a replacement for Gobbetti, who is leaving four years into his plan to take the brand further upmarket. The announcement of his departure sent Burberry's shares down 10%. Burberry, known for its trench coats and trademark plaid, said in British national Akeroyd, 54, was the right choice to build on its creative heritage. ""Jonathan is an experienced leader with a strong track record in building global luxury fashion brands and driving profitable growth,"" Chair Gerry Murphy said. During his five years at Italy's Versace, Akeroyd had accelerated growth and elevated product, Burberry said. Before that, from 2004-2016, he led the turnaround of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen. While COVID-19 has over the last months hurt Burberry's sales by closing its stores across the world, the brand has since recovered. It said in July its like-for-like sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven by new, younger fans of Riccardo Tisci, the designer who Gobbetti brought in to revitalise the brand and who investors are relieved is staying put. Gobbetti's departure has been cast as a personal decision to return to Italy, where he will lead the Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo. Gobbetti will leave Burberry on Dec. 31. The group said that Murphy would chair the executive committee for the four months until Akeroyd joins on Apr. 1.

LIVE MARKETS-IPO trick or treat¬"* Major U.S. equity indexes gain; Nasdaq out front * Energy leads major S&P sector gainers; staples weakest group * Dollar down; gold, crude, bitcoin rise * U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield ~1.63% Oct 19 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com IPO TRICK OR TREAT (1345 EDT/1745 GMT) There's no slowdown in sight for the IPO market as 18 companies hope to go public before Halloween. Choppy aftermarket deal performance, however, has spooked investors. Several firms bagged their listing plans recently, , including Peloton rival iFIT Health & Fitness. Even the offering for accounts payable automation software firm AvidXchange, which appeared headed for a sweet outcome, failed to pay off for the IPO investors. AVDX shares are still trading about 4% below their issue price on Tuesday. This backdrop certainly sets up a buyers' market for new issues. Below is the current roster of IPO candidates, by anticipated debut date and approximate deal size: Oct 20: Stronghold Digital Mining (cryptocurrency) ($100m) Oct 21: Enfusion (financial software) ($300m) P10 (asset management) ($300m) Portillo’s (casual restaurants) ($375m) Runway Growth Finance (BDC) ($100m) Ventyx Biosciences (biotech) ($125m) Vita Coco (beverages) ($225m) Winc (direct-to-consumer winemaker) ($75m) Oct 22: Aris Water (frack-water recycling) ($300m) Minerva Surgical (medical devices) ($100m) Xilio Therapeutics (biotech) ($125m) Oct 27: Informatica (software) ($900m) Rent the Runway (direct-to-consumer clothing) ($300m) Arteris (semiconductors) ($75m) Oct 28: Candela Medical (medtech) ($250m) Ensemble Health (healthcare software) ($600m) Fluence Energy (alt energy) ($700m) GlobalFoundries (semiconductors) ($2.5b) (Lance Tupper) ***** CREDIT SPREADS AND THE THREE BEAR FLATTENER PROBLEMS (1236 EDT/1636 GMT) A recent sharp bear flattener move in the U.S. Treasury yield curve poses at least three problems for corporate bond credit spreads that could lead to widening for investment-grade debt and underperformance in the belly of the spread curve, according to a BofA Global Research report this week. The yield curve move, which resulted from market pricing for an earlier start to Federal Reserve rate hikes, ""reduces incentives for fixed-income investors to move out the curve, both into credit and out the maturity curve within credit,"" BofA credit strategists wrote. Secondly, a flatter yield curve makes U.S. corporate bonds less attractive on a dollar-hedged basis for foreign investors unless other yield curves flatten globally to the same extent, they added. ""The third problem with a bear flattener is the risk of sizable outflows in the belly of the curve as, unlike in the front and back ends, there would be little natural buying on weakness and thus the potential for sizable spread widening,"" the report said. Here is a chart of the U.S. 30-Year Treasury - U.S. 5-year Treasury yield spread: (Karen Pierog) ***** CHANGES COMING TO THE GICS? (1215 EDT/1615 GMT) S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc announced late Monday they have begun a consultation with members of the investment community on potential changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure. The GICS was developed in 1999 and is a four-tiered classification system comprised of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries, with each company assigned a single GICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity The consultation period began on Oct. 18 and is scheduled to end on Dec. 20. S&P and MSCI said they would announce any changes to the GICS structure by February 2022, although the consultation ""may or may not result in any changes."" The most recent reshuffle of the GICS came in September 2018, with the creation of the communication services sector https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-gics/a-close-up-of-wall-sts-new-sp-500-communication-services-sector-idUSL2N1W61WT that siphoned off names such as Facebook and Alphabet from the tech sector and Netflix from the consumer discretionary sector. Current topics up for consideration would affect the energy sector, the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors, as well as the tech and industrials sectors. Also up for discussion are classifications for banks, REITs, transportation and the definition of pharmaceuticals for cannabis inclusion. Below is a summary of potential changes, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices: (Chuck Mikolajczak) ***** FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT ON EARNINGS (1108 EDT/1508 GMT) While estimate-beating big bank third quarter profits sent stocks higher last week, Nuveen said it's approaching the rest of the earnings season ""with a degree of caution."" In a report this week, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, said that factors such as COVID-19's Delta variant, supply chains, inflation, and the end of federal stimulus, will likely keep third quarter earnings growth rates for S&P 500 companies in the 30% to 35% range, down from the first quarter when they eventually topped 50%. ""In fact, earnings revisions for the third quarter are the lowest of 2021 so far, with estimates increasing by a modest 3%-4% since the end of June, versus double-digit percentage increases in the previous two quarters,"" the report said. ""Guidance has been more moderate, too; nearly half of companies reporting so far have issued negative (earnings per share) guidance."" Still, Nuveen noted that trailing and forward-looking valuations for the S&P 500 have fallen 10% to 20% from first quarter levels, which should allow equities to grind higher even in the face of decelerating earnings growth. ""The best-positioned companies are those that can build inventories and protect/grow their margins until the headwinds created by inflation and global supply chain disruptions begin to dissipate,"" it added. (Karen Pierog) ***** MMM INFLATION (1025 EDT/1425 GMT) 'Mmm Danone' has long been the ending note of TV commercials for the French consumer group's yoghurts, but today it has somewhat of a sour ring to it. Danone shares have been in a downward trend all session, and are now falling about 3%, the worst performance of the blue chips which make the EURO STOXX 50 index. The group's Q3 earnings themselves - the group stuck to its 2021 guidance - don't seem so much to blame for the poor performance. ""It's the comments about the inflation and the supply chain"", argued Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition. CFO Juergen Esser told analysts in a conference call that inflation costs were expected to rise at least 8% in 2022 and said shipping in Asia was under high tension. But inflation is also seen impacting the price of milk, ingredients and packaging. While many strategists are trying to shift their portfolios toward assets like commodities or financials stocks which typically thrive when prices rise, Danone seems to be battling precisely on the front line of inflation, perhaps not the most comfortable place to be. As Citi analysts point out in their rating about Danone, some of the risks to their target price of 66 euros lays in ""the wholesale price of milk, as dairy inputs equal about 15% of sales"". Price of PET resin, which is used to make containers for food and drinks, is also an important cost.

That said, over the past three months, multi-day winning streaks have led to sudden setbacks: From late-July into early-October, NQcv1 has struggled in the wake of a three-to-five-day run of gains. There have been six such streaks over this period, and on average, NQcv1 then sold off nearly 3% over the next four trading days or so. NQcv1 last rose more than five-straight days with a seven-day win streak in mid-June. The futures are also rapidly nearing resistance hurdles in the form of the 76.4%/78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Sept. 7-Oct. 4 decline, in the 15,386.54/15,415.88 area, and the Sept. 27 high, at 15,399.25. This resistance should provide an interesting test for the futures, especially given the current win streak, and that the Nasdaq has been relying on its largest caps to underpin gains. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures are also on track for a 5th-straight day of gains. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 index, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE FANG+TM Index have all risen four-straight days.

UPDATE 2-Norway's Yara beats Q3 forecasts, keeps cap on ammonia output¬"(Adds detail) OSLO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Fertiliser maker Yara posted stronger than expected third-quarter core profits on Wednesday but said high gas costs would continue to curtail the Norwegian company's ammonia output. July-September earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding one-off items, rose to $765 million from $558 million a year earlier and topped the $738 million expected by analysts according to a Refinitiv poll. Yara said higher prices for its products more than offset lower deliveries and increased input costs. Last month, Yara cut its ammonia output in Europe by 40%, equivalent to 1.9 million tonnes, as soaring gas prices made European ammonia production unprofitable. The front-month gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, has almost quadrupled this year to record levels, amid high demand as economies recover from the pandemic and below-average levels of gas in storage at the start of the winter heating season. Natural gas is the most important cost input for nitrogen-based chemicals and fertilisers, including ammonia. Yara said it expected to pay $850 million more for natural gas in the fourth quarter than a year earlier, and $950 million more in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2021. However, since Yara is cutting ammonia output in Europe, it is buying less gas and so the cost impact, Yara said, would depend on the duration of the curtailed output. Yara said it expected an ""even tighter market situation"" for nitrogen in 2022 due to strong demand and curbed output in Europe. ""European nitrogen production is essential to global food security, and we are therefore concerned about the impact current European natural gas prices will have, especially for the world's poorest regions,"" CEO Svein Tore Holsether said in a statement. Yara has capacity to produce 8.6 million tonnes of ammonia a year across its plants annually, with more than half of this - 4.8 million tonnes - in Europe. It has an overall production capacity of just under 23 million tonnes of finished products used to fertilise crops but also as explosives and cleaning exhaust from diesel engines, among other applications. Almost three-quarters of Yara's finished products are made in Europe, home to the company's two biggest plants, in Sluiskil in the Netherlands and Porsgrunn, Norway.

UPDATE 2-Roche expects higher 2021 sales as Delta spurs COVID-19 tests¬"* 2021 sales seen growing in mid-single digit range, Q3 sales beat * COVID testing likely to continue into Q4 2022 - senior exec * Roche points to signs of recovery in pharma unit sales (Writes through with executive, analyst comments, background) By Pushkala Aripaka Oct 20 (Reuters) - Roche raised its 2021 sales forecast on Wednesday after demand for COVID-19 tests and medicines was boosted by the highly contagious Delta variant and the wider business performed well, helping the Swiss drugmaker beat revenue expectations. The company now predicts overall 2021 sales will grow in the mid-single digit range at constant exchange rates, having previously expected them to rise in the low to mid-single digit percentage range. ""The demand for coronavirus tests remained high in the third quarter due to the Delta variant,"" Chief Executive Severin Schwan said. Roche in July had flagged an expected slowdown in demand for the tests in the second half of the year, but management was more confident this time. ""(COVID-19) testing is likely to continue into the fourth quarter, and likely into next year. The question is the level of testing,"" said Thomas Schinecker, head of Roche's diagnostics business. That would depend on several factors, including the pace of vaccination, Schinecker added on a media call. Group sales in the three months to September rose 8% to 15.97 billion Swiss francs ($17.29 billion), the company said, as diagnostics division revenues jumped 18%. Analysts on average were expecting sales of 15.48 billion francs, according to Jefferies. ""The quality of the beat is somewhat worse than we wished for - key growth drivers underperformed,"" Vontobel analysts said in a note, adding that the beat comes from Actemra, which profits from the pandemic, and a slower erosion of key oncology drugs. Shares in the company were down 0.3% by 0848 GMT, compared to a near 1% rise in the wider European pharmaceuticals index . Roche, whose medicines RoActemra/Actemra and Ronapreve have been critical to COVID-19 treatment in several countries, said supply of biological ingredients for those drugs was improving after the situation had been tight. There have also been signs of recovery in the pharmaceuticals unit since the summer, the company said, after the pandemic hurt sales. A plethora of new launches, including an Alzheimer's treatment if approved by U.S. authorities, are expected to bolster future sales at Roche as it faces increasing competition for older drugs. Final data from a study of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral pill, which Roche is working on with Atea, will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication and the partners will continue to analyse data, the company said. The pill had failed to help patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a small study of mostly low-risk patients, delivering a major setback to the firms.

Los bunds alemanes no se inmutan ante la dimisión del presidente del Bundesbank, Weidmann -- Market Talk¬"(Sharecast News) - 0954 GMT - Los bunds alemanes no se inmutan después de que Jens Weidmann, presidente del Deutsche Bundesbank, anunciase este miércoles su dimisión, efectiva a finales de año, alegando motivos personales. El rendimiento del Bund a 10 años cotiza 0,6 puntos básicos por debajo del -0,118%, tras haber cotizado al -0,116% antes de la declaración. Weidmann es conocido por ser un defensor de una política monetaria más estricta en el Consejo de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo (BCE) y de la disciplina fiscal. El economista de Berenberg, Holger Schmieding, afirma que el nuevo gobierno alemán probablemente nombrará a un sucesor menos ""duro"", y entre los posibles candidatos se encuentra Isabel Schnabel, que actualmente forma parte del consejo del BCE.

Amryt Pharma granted another two US patents¬"(Sharecast News) - Commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company Amryt Pharma updated the market on patents for its lead development candidate 'Oleogel-S10' on Tuesday, as well as its recently-acquired and third commercial product 'Mycapssa'. The AIM-traded firm said the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a new US formulation patent for Oleogel-S10, titled 'Betulin-Containing Birch Bark Extracts and their Formulation'. It said that if Oleogel-S10 was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the patent would be listable in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the 'Orange Book', published by the FDA. The patent would expire in January 2039. Together with three previously-granted patents, if Oleogel-S10 was approved, Amryt said it would have four Orange Book-listed patents for Oleogel-S10, with patent protection through January 2039, without patent term extension. The company said the USPTO also issued a new US patent related to the Mycapssa, granting claims covering ""methods of administering oral octreotide with certain oral contraceptives"". It said the patent would expire in December 2040, and would also be listable in the Orange Book. Amryt said it now had eight Orange Book-listed patents for Mycapssa, with patent protection through December 2040. ""We are always working to develop and extend our intellectual property portfolio, and today's news further illustrates the robust IP protection enjoyed by both our commercial and development assets,"" said chief executive officer Joe Wiley.

UPDATE 3-UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike¬"* UK inflation slips to 3.1% in Sept from 3.2% in Aug * Dip likely only a temporary respite * Bank of England gearing up to act, possibly on Nov. 4 * Hospitality drags on inflation in Sept due to base effects (Adds details, graphic) By Andy Bruce LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month but the decline was probably only a temporary respite for consumers and is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates, possibly as soon as next month. Consumer prices rose by 3.1% in annual terms in September, easing back from August's 3.2% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to inflation of 3.2% in September although 11 of the 34 analysts who took part predicted a slowdown. Overall, the figures did little to change expectations that the BoE will become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates, with investors increasingly betting it will do so on Nov. 4 after its next policy meeting. Yael ?Selfin, KPMG UK's chief economist, said despite the slight slowdown in inflation it had topped 3% for two months in a row, hurting the spending power of households some of whom could also face higher mortgage costs if BoE hikes rates. ""We expect further increases in inflation from October, which could reach around 4% by the end of the year, with the recent rise in wholesale energy prices passed on to households,"" Selfin said. Hospitality was the largest drag on inflation last month - the result of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant meal subsidy scheme launched in August 2020 dropping out of the annual comparisons. Prices for diners rose sharply in September last year after the scheme expired. But prices for consumer goods continued to rise, while food prices fell more slowly than in September last year. Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to rise slightly above 4% in the last quarter of 2021 but since then energy prices have continued to rise sharply. On Sunday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey sent a latest signal that the British central bank was gearing up to raise rates for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus crisis as the risks from inflation mounted. The ONS data suggested more inflation pressure on the way. Prices of goods produced by factories rose again, led by a jump for metals and machinery as well as surging energy prices. ""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said. ACT IN HASTE... Some economists think the BoE risks making a mistake if it raises rates now because many of the inflation pressures in the British economy are global in nature and beyond its influence. ""Domestically generated inflation remains relatively weak in these data,"" said economist Benjamin Nabarro from Citi. He said the strain on prices was likely to ease in the second half of 2022. The increase in inflation in the year to September was driven by a relatively small number of items, with motor fuels and second-hand cars accounting for about a quarter of the annual inflation rate. ""The big questions for policymakers now are just how temporary these price pressures will be, and whether they'll translate into stronger pay growth,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank. ""Britain's recent history suggests that high inflation feeds through into real wage falls instead – a lesson families can ill-afford to learn for a third time in a decade.""

Delta subvariant won't change COVID picture, Oxford vaccine chief says¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - A subvariant of Delta that is growing in England is being monitored but is not likely to change the COVID-19 picture, Oxford Vaccine Group chief Andrew Pollard said on Wednesday. The subvariant, designated as AY.4.2 in Britain, is growing and accounted for about 6% of all sequences generated, the UK Health Security Agency said last week, but it has not been labelled as ""under investigation"" or a ""variant of concern"". ""Discovery of new variants is of course important to monitor, but it doesn't indicate that that new variant is going to be the next one to replace Delta,"" Pollard told BBC radio. ""Indeed even if it does, Delta is incredibly good at transmitting in a vaccinated population and a new one may be a bit better but it's unlikely to change the picture dramatically from where we are today.""

IN BRIEF: SolGold gives resource estimate for Tandayama-America¬"SolGold PLC - miner - Provides maiden mineral resource estimate for the Tandayama-America porphyry copper-gold deposit at the Cascabel project in Ecuador, at 233.0 million tonnes at a grade of 0.33% copper equivalent containing 530,000 tonnes of copper and 1.2 million ounces of gold in the indicated category. Meanwhile, the inferred category contains 197.0 million tonnes at 0.39% copper equivalent containing 520,000 tonnes of copper and 1.24 million ounces of gold. Drilling will continue and an update to the resource base is planned. ""The TAM deposit adds further copper and gold mineralisation to Alpala's large metal inventory at the Cascabel project. The resource offers optionality and the potential to generate economic ore earlier which will complement the high-grade Alpala underground ore,"" says Interim Chief Executive Officer Keith Marshall. ""The maiden MRE is based on assays from the first 18 holes. Drilling has continued at the TAM deposit during the estimation process and visual mineralisation from holes 19-30 suggest potential for future resource growth in the southeast quarter of the open pit optimised shape and particularly in the east and southeast depth extensions of the underground optimised shape where the highest grade mineralisation encountered thus far remains open,"" Marshall adds.

Wednesday newspaper round-up: Evergrande, Credit Suisse, Halifax¬"(Sharecast News) - The rescue of embattled Chinese property company Evergrande appears to have stalled, leaving the developer on the brink of default and threatening to unleash contagion through the country's giant real estate sector, home prices and the economy. The problems enveloping Evergrande, which has eyewatering total debts of $305bn, have hung over global financial markets in recent weeks and helped curb China's post-pandemic recovery. - Guardian Credit Suisse has been fined nearly £350m by global regulators, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and agreed to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debt owed by Mozambique in an attempt to draw a line under the long-running ""tuna bonds"" loan scandal. The Swiss banking company had been accused of ""serious"" failings in its financial crime controls by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice that will put the bank under heavy monitoring for three years after having ""defrauded US and international investors"". - Guardian Halifax has relaxed mortgage borrowing rules for millions of wealthy homebuyers in a bet that the property market will remain resilient despite the threat of rising interest rates. Britain's biggest housing lender will now hand borrowers who earn more than £75,000 a loan of up to five-and-a-half times their annual income, up from a previous limit of five times. - Telegraph More than 140m  have watched the South Korean drama Squid Game since its release last month, making it the most-watched show in Netflix's history.

FOREX-Yen skids to four-year low as stocks rally with Treasury yields¬"* Rise in 10-year U.S. yields increase allure for Japan investors * Two-year yields drop as traders cut bets for early Fed lift-off * Dollar hurt as other central banks seen outpacing Fed tightening * Safe-haven yen, dollar out of favour amid global equity rally * Aussie, kiwi gain to multi-month peaks; bitcoin near record high By Kevin Buckland TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. bonds drove currencies on Wednesday, with a rise in long-term rates pushing the dollar to an almost four-year high on the yen, but a decline in shorter-dated yields putting it on the back foot against most other major peers. The dollar and yen were also under pressure from a global equity rally that sapped demand for assets regarded as safe havens. The dollar climbed as high as 114.585 yen for the first time since November 2017, with benchmark 10-year Treasury yields touching a fresh five-month high at 1.6630% in Asia. Higher long-term U.S. yields increase the allure of those assets to Japanese investors. However, two-year Treasury yields hovered around 0.4016% after retreating sharply overnight from Monday's 19-month high of 0.4480%, signalling a scaling back of bets for early Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. That contrasted to a rise this week in bets on faster rate increases in the U.K. and New Zealand, which also pulled up expectations in neighbours like the euro zone and Australia. The risk-sensitive Aussie and New Zealand dollars touched fresh multi-month highs on Wednesday, and cryptocurrency bitcoin hovered close to an all-time high. ""Risk sentiment remains in the ascendancy,"" while ""a fall-back in front-end U.S. yields, so symptomatic of a slight paring back in expectations for when Fed rates 'lift-off' might occur,"" dealt the dollar a double-whammy, Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, wrote in a research note. At the same time, markets are coming to ""the - highly belated - realisation that whether the Fed raises (its policy) rate in 2022 or not until later, other central banks are getting in ahead of them ... with the Bank of England likely next cab off the rank as early as next month,"" Attrill said. The dollar index - which measures the greenback versus six rivals, including the yen - slipped 0.12% to 93.698, dropping back toward Tuesday's low at 93.501, the weakest level this month. Just last week it hit a one-year high of 94.563 as traders priced in a tapering of Fed stimulus as soon as next month, followed by rate hikes next year. The U.S. economic outlook got a little less rosy on Tuesday after data showed that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labour, supporting expectations that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter. The euro added 0.15% to $$1.1649 from Tuesday, when it jumped as high as $1.1670 for the first time since Sept. 29. Sterling rose 0.16% to $1.3810 after touching a one-month peak of $1.3834 in the previous session. The Aussie traded 0.31% higher at $0.7500, after touching the highest since July 7 at $0.7505. New Zealand's kiwi dollar climbed 0.32% to $0.7177, and earlier reached $0.7179 for the first time since June 11. Bitcoin weakened slightly to just below $64,000 after touching a six-month high of $64,499 on Tuesday, close to its record peak at $64,895.22. In the equities space, Asia-Pacific stocks extended a global rally on Wednesday, with an index of regional shares adding 0.51%. ""The move in equities has seen the USD and JPY shunned,"" Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a client note. ""It's really just pick a JPY cross and see the 'rip your face off' move,"" he said.

Alphawave IP Group reports strong quarterly bookings as demand rises¬"(Alliance News) - Alphawave IP Group PLC on Wednesday reported ""strong"" third quarter, with new client wins and improved demand in North America and South Korea. The London and Toronto-based connectivity platform provider said total annual bookings to date exceeded USD219 million, with a robust pipeline for further bookings in the final quarter of 2021. Bookings in the third quarter alone totalled USD23.2 million and were driven by four new customer wins, the company noted. ""As we outlined at our half year results in September, we have seen strong growth in our pipeline particularly in North America and South Korea,"" said President & Chief Executive Tony Pialis. ""We are driving greater diversification across customers and geographies, while demonstrating our continued technology leadership in the most advanced process technologies,"" added Executive Chair John Lofton. Alphawave IP Group shares were trading 0.9% lower in London on Wednesday morning at 262.64 pence each. In addition, the company said it has achieved an acceleration of end customer wins in China through its reseller agreement with silicon platform-as-a-service company VeriSilicon Microelectronics (Shanghai) Co Ltd. In the third quarter, Alphawave IP Group said two end customers in China licensed its technology through this agreement, with a total transaction value of USD3.9 million, excluding potential future royalties. The revenue from these China customer wins are not included within the total bookings figure of USD219 million, the company noted. The update on VeriSilicon comes as the article in the Financial Times at the end of September asserted that Alphawave IP Group had not ""adequately disclosed its related party transactions"". Alphawave IP Group said at the rime that it signed a USD54 million multi-year exclusive subscription reseller agreement with VeriSilicon in February, prior to its London float, and has not recognised any revenue from that deal to date.

Segro stated that £26.0m of new headline rent was signed during the quarter, up from £16.0m at the same time a year earlier and taking the total for the nine months to 30 September to £64.0m. Vacancy rates were reduced further to 3.2% from the 4.3% seen at the end of June, predominantly due to strong demand for recently completed speculatively developed space, while year-to-date customer retention came to 76% after the firm took back some space in urban estates in London and Paris. Chief executive David Sleath said: ""Segro has had an active and successful third quarter as we continue to capitalise on strong occupier and investment market conditions, with high leasing volumes across the business.

LIVE MARKETS-Small-time investors didn't go gaga over new bitcoin futures ETF¬"* European stocks, Wall Street futures flat * Nestle shines * Kering, ASML disappoint * Miners worst performers across STOXX 600 * Bundesbank's Weidmann quits Oct 20 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com SMALL-TIME INVESTORS DIDN'T GO GAGA OVER NEW BITCOIN FUTURES ETF (1230 GMT) Although there are signs that ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF snapped up flows from individual investors in its first day of trading, the volume of purchases were not impressive, according to strategists at Vanda Research. The first U.S. bitcoin futures-based ETF ended 2.6% higher in the prior session with $1 bln worth shares changing hands. Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Trends noted there were very few block trades in the ETF, suggesting smaller investors and high-frequency trading firms dominated trading. BITO also ranked #2 in terms of order volumes on Fidelity's brokerage platform, another signal of retail interest. ""Most pundits interpreted the massive trading volumes as a roaring success for BITO. From retail investors' perspective, it wasn't as much of a blockbuster,"" wrote Vanda Research's Ben Onantibia and Giacomo Pierantoni in a note. According to their data, retail investors only bought $7.68 mln in BITO shares on Tuesday, a similar amount as other crypto proxy stocks like Riot Blockchain Inc ($7.5 mln) and Coinbase Global Inc ($4.5 mln). In comparison, retail demand for Coinbase debut in March was 7-times larger than for BITO ($57 mln), they added. However, it's not very surprising as retail investors prefer single stocks rather than ETFs, strategists explained. ARK's Space Exploration & Innovation ETF has not been very popular with retail investors but some stocks like Virgin Galactic have been all-time retail favourites, they argued. A similar trend is observed with Cannabis ETFs, as purchases are usually concentrated in Tilray and Sundial Growers Inc rather than well-known ETFs like Global X Cannabis ETF or AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, Vanda strategists said. (Medha Singh) ***** STRONG EARNINGS TO ALLEVIATE REFINANCING NEEDS (1156 GMT) After a borrowing spree in 2020 to bolster liquidity amid the COVID pandemic, total debt of EMEA speculative-grade companies analysed by Moody's is now stable at $1.6 trillion, unchanged since last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Telecoms has overtaken autos to become the sector with highest level of debt per company. The good news is stronger earnings this year will alleviate companies refinancing needs. ""Higher cash reserves, improved free cash flow will provide some leeway on the amount of debt that needs to be refinanced"", the rating agency said. Moody's analysts forecast EMEA speculative-grade companies will generate 60 billion dollars more in free cash flow in next year than in 2020. But things will go differently depending on sectors: high- capital spending or dividend heavy businesses, such as utilities, transport and real estate, will have ""weak or negative free cash flow"", Moody's say. While the main increases will arise in the sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, automotive, services and energy, they add. (Joice Alves) ***** DANONE: DOWN! NESTLE: UP! UNILEVER? (1017 GMT) Inflation is definitely a key theme for this earnings season and so far, not all stocks are weathering that storm in the same way. It's particularly obvious among consumer staples with Danone falling 3% yesterday after executives at the French yoghurt giant warned of price rising for milk, ingredients, packaging and shipping. It's a different story for Nestle this morning. The Swiss consumer group is up 3.5% after raising its sales target and beating consensus amid strong coffee sales. All in all, the kitkat maker's earnings made a convincing case. ""We see this beat as reassuring after yesterday’s negative read across from peers"", a Citi note commented, while other analysts stressed that popular consumer staples have a decisive edge up their sleeve against inflation. ""Most companies with strong brands will be able to pass on prices and I think the market still does not get that,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox when commenting on Nestle's results. Procter & Gamble said on Tuesday it would raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the U.S. to counter higher commodity and freight costs. How successful big brands will be in convincing consumers to gobble some inflation rather than buying less popular but cheaper products? Investors interested in finding out will be looking closely at Unilever's results tomorrow to see whether the maker of Knorr soups will cut its profit margin forecast for the second time this year. Unilever makes about 60% of its turnover in emerging markets, where inflation is fiercest. All in all though, consumer staples have been struggling to keep up with the broader market. ""This may be partly due to how investors have been looking for cyclical companies that could benefit from an economic upturn in the wake of pandemic, and show a rapid recovery in earnings, such as oils, banks and miners, rather than Steady Eddies like Unilever"", AJ Bell analysts argued last week in a note. Below you can see how Danone, Unilever and Nestle, big defensive stocks, outperformed the STOXX 600 in the aftermath of the COVID-19 and how they now trail behind: Some reading: P&G to increase prices further as commodity, freight costs bite Inflation trade? Nestle reaps benefits from higher prices Danone warns of growing cost pressures into 2022 (Julien Ponthus) ***** THE TWO SIDES OF BRITAIN PLC IN A CHART (0959 GMT) A revival in value, banks and energy stocks, coupled with a weaker sterling is boosting interest for UK large-caps. But on the other hand, growing post-Brexit challenges and the prospect of higher interest rates weigh on UK domestic companies. As a result, the exporter-focused FTSE 100 -- which makes about 60% of its revenue abroad -- is thriving, while UK mid caps are lagging behind. Barclays sees rising risks for domestic recovery weighing on the FTSE 250 -- heavy on industrials, discretionary, staples, and diversified financials, all sectors that could be pressured by a slowdown in the UK economy. ""We see challenges from Brexit compounding COVID-related supply issues and an unfavourable mix of early fiscal and monetary tightening,"" Barclays says. (Joice Alves) ****** EUROPEAN SHARES SEEK DIRECTION AFTER MIXED BATCH OF EARNINGS (0750 GMT) European shares are edging up as traders digest a batch of mixed earnings results. The pan-European STOXX 600 started the day in the red but it has gained some grounds and is now 0.1% higher. Strong results from Swiss food giant Nestle, which raised its sales outlook, were partially offset by underwhelming reports from French luxury group Kering and Dutch semiconductor company ASML. Kering tumbles 4% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of COVID recovery, particularly in Asia. London blue chips are little changed as fears that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in two weeks persist as the unexpected slowdown in inflation in September is seen as temporary. Shares in Antofagasta slip to the bottom of the FTSE after its Q3 production report. Other miners -- Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American -- are among the worst performers in London on lower metal prices. (Joice Alves) **** MARGIN PRESSURES (0718 GMT) Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Sujata Rao) ***** INFLATION DATA, EARNINGS FOR BREAKFAST (0640 GMT) Futures are pointing to a start of the day in the red for European bourses amid cautious about the global economic outlook with rising inflation expectations driving the market. Data showed this morning, British inflation slowed unexpectedly in September but the decline probably marked a temporary respite for consumers and the Bank of England is expected to address the acceleration by raising interests rates, possibly in two weeks. In the corporate front, as a slew of companies are reporting their earnings, traders are getting some much-needed guidance. For instance, Nestle, Deliveroo and Swiss drugmaker Roche upgraded guidance after strong Q3 results. {nL8N2RG0RX] But supply chain disruptions is biting.

UPDATE 2-U.S. says Credit Suisse to pay $475 mln to resolve Mozambican scandal charges¬"(Adds Credit Suisse and VTB comment, context, details) By Chris Prentice Oct 19 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has agreed to pay about $475 million to American and British authorities to resolve bribery and fraud charges related to Mozambican bond offerings while a subsidiary pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in New York, another blow for the scandal-plagued Swiss bank. The bribery and fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Justice Department and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority centered on the Zurich-based bank's role in a $2 billion scandal involving Mozambican government-guaranteed loans. The SEC said Credit Suisse fraudulently misled investors and violated U.S. bribery laws in a scheme involving two bond offerings and a syndicated loan that raised funds on behalf of state-owned entities in Mozambique. The bank has entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, while subsidiary Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, or CSSEL, pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in New York to one criminal count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. As part of the settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to pay a fine of approximately $200 million to the British authorities and to forgive $200 million of debt owed by Mozambique. As a result, the bank said it expects to take $230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021. ""Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by US, UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank's arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises,"" the bank said in a statement. A London-based subsidiary of Russian bank VTB also agreed to pay more than $6 million to settle SEC charges related to the Mozambique loans. ""VTB takes today's settlement seriously and fully cooperated with the SEC investigation,"" the bank said. Credit Suisse has been embroiled in a string of scandals https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-scandals-prompt-switzerland-think-unthinkable-punish-bankers-2021-05-28 including heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos, client-losses stemming from the collapse of supply chain finance Greensill, and allegations of corporate espionage. Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, who joined the bank in April from Britain's Lloyds, has said the scandals facing the bank are the gravest he has seen in his career. The U.S. settlement was announced just minutes before Switzerland's financial regulator took action against the bank for snooping on its former top wealth management executive Iqbal Khan and others. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA, said the bank was found to have had ""serious organizational shortcomings"" surrounding the espionage that ultimately triggered the departure of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. FINMA said in a statement that it has imposed measures on the bank, reprimanded two individuals and opened enforcement proceedings against three additional individuals, without naming them. Credit Suisse said in its statement that with Tuesday's actions it ""can now draw a line under"" the Mozambican matter. Regarding cause of the FINMA action, Credit Suisse added, ""The bank condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes."" The SEC's Tuesday resolution is the latest development in the multi-year Mozambique saga for Credit Suisse, with private litigation still ongoing. The African nation is suing Credit Suisse and shipbuilder Privinvest in London's High Court over a hefty chunk of the $2 billion in loans which went missing.

Rio Tinto in $7.5bn plan to halve carbon emissions by 2030¬"(Sharecast News) - Mining giant Rio Tinto said it planned to invest $7.5bn halving carbon emissions by 2030, more than tripling its previous target. The Anglo-Australian firm on Wednesday said the plan would apply to direct and indirect emissions. It added that it was also targeting a 15% cut to emissions by 2025, five years earlier than previously. Rio also said it expects to rapidly deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar and wind power generation in the key Pilbara iron-ore production region in Western Australia to replace gas-fired power generation. The Boyne Island and Tomago aluminium smelters will be decarbonised, which will require an estimated 5 GW of solar and wind power generation. Rio's aluminium business accounts for 70% of its scope 1 and 2 emissions. ""In recognition of the broader carbon footprint of the commodities it produces, Rio Tinto will accelerate its investment in research and development of technologies that enable its customers to decarbonise,"" the company said. ""Working in partnership with governments, suppliers, customers, academia and others Rio Tinto will continue to develop technologies ... for carbon-free aluminium and multiple pathways to produce green steel."" Rio added that it would prioritise growth capital in commodities, with an ambition to double growth capital expenditure to about $3bn a year from 2023 to meet extra demand created by the global drive to net zero emissions. ""All our commodities are vital for the energy transition and continue to benefit from ongoing urbanisation.

Metro Bank loan book drops but pleased with improved lending mix¬"(Alliance News) - Metro Bank PLC on Wednesday reported an improvement in its lending mix in the third quarter, but saw its loan book fall. At September 30, the challenger bank's loan book stood at GBP12.32 billion, down slightly from GBP12.33 billion three months earlier, and down 18% from GBP15.09 billion at the same point the year before. ""Third quarter total net loans of were broadly flat and reflected growth in consumer unsecured lending and specialist mortgages, offset by the attrition of lower-yielding residential mortgages and commercial term loans including the initial repayment of Bounce Back Loan Scheme,"" Metro said. ""Front-book yield continued to improve benefiting from the mix shift towards higher-yielding lending categories, partially offset by pricing pressures in the mortgage market. Credit impairments were benign, in line with guidance provided at the half year,"" the lender continued. Deposits stood at GBP16.41 billion on September 30, down slightly from GBP16.62 billion at June 30, but up from GBP15.62 billion the year before. Chief Executive Daniel Frumkin said: ""The bank has continued to deliver against its strategic priorities during the quarter. We have seen improvements in our lending mix from our expanded product offering. We are seeing signs of a gradual return to normality and have adopted a hybrid way of working for office-based colleagues. We remain focused on executing on our plans and returning the Bank to sustainable profitable growth."" Metro's minimum requirement for own funds & eligible liabilities, MREL, currently exceeds its requirement of 20.5%.

INSIGHT-AI can see through you: CEOs' language under machine microscope¬"(Repeats for additional subscribers, with no changes) * Natural language processing (NLP) increasingly popular * Investors seek edge in world of 'unstructured data' * But CEOs are cottoning on, with more speech scripted By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Executives, beware! You could become your own worst enemy. CEOs and other managers are increasingly under the microscope as some investors use artificial intelligence to learn and analyse their language patterns and tone, opening up a new frontier of opportunities to slip up. In late 2020, according to language pattern software specialist Evan Schnidman, some executives in the IT industry were playing down the possibility of semiconductor chip shortages while discussing supply-chain disruptions. All was fine, they said. Yet the tone of their speech showed high levels of uncertainty, according to an algorithmic analysis designed to spot hidden clues in - ideally unscripted - spoken words. ""We found that IT sector executives' tone was inconsistent with the positive textual sentiment of their remarks,"" said Schnidman, who advises two fintech companies behind the analysis. Within months of the comments, companies including Volkswagen and Ford were warning about a severe shortage of chips hitting output. Share prices in auto and industrial firms fell. IT executives now said there was a supply squeeze. Schnidman holds that computer-driven quant funds accessing scores assigned to the tone of the managers' words, versus scores assigned to the written words, would have been better positioned before the industry turmoil. One example can't testify to the accuracy of the speech analysis, though, as we don't know if the executives were being unduly optimistic at the outset or sincerely altered their views as circumstances changed. Some investors nonetheless see the technology - known as natural language processing (NLP) - as one new tool to gain an edge over rivals, according to Reuters interviews with 11 fund managers that are using or trialling such systems. They say traditional financial data and corporate statements are so heavily mined nowadays that they offer little value. 'SOMETHING VERY MESSY' NLP is a branch of AI where machine learning is let loose on language to make sense of it, and then turn it into quantifiable signals that quant funds factor into trading. The most ambitious software in this area aims to analyse the audible tones, cadence and emphases of spoken words alongside phraseology, while others look to parse the transcripts of speeches and interviews in increasingly sophisticated ways. Slavi Marinov, head of machine learning at Man AHL, part of the $135 billion investment management firm Man Group, told Reuters that NLP was ""one of the major research areas of focus"" at the computer-driven fund. ""These models transform something that is very messy to something that is easily understandable by a quant,"" he said. Indeed advocates say NLP can unlock the untapped potential for insight from the world of ""unstructured data"": the calls with analysts, the unscripted Q&As, the media interviews. This is open to debate, though. These AI systems can cost millions of dollars to develop and run, ruling out many investors and developers save the deep-pocketed or niche. Some are also at a comparatively experimental stage, with no publicly available data to show that they make money. The funds interviewed declined to show proof that NLP can augment returns, citing commercial sensitivities. Some studies suggest the techniques could boost performance if focused in smart places, though. Analysis in September by Nomura's quant strategists showed a link between the complexity of executives' language during earnings calls and shares. U.S. bosses who used simple language saw their companies' shares outperform by 6% per annum since 2014, compared with those using complex wording. BofA analysts employ a model that uses phrases in earnings calls to forecast corporate bond default rates. This examines thousands of phrases such as ""cost cutting"" and ""cash burn"" to find phrases associated with future defaults. Back-testing the model showed a high correlation with default probabilities, BofA said. Both systems analyse transcripts. MACHINE MEASURING CULTURE In years gone by, language processing in finance has featured basic and widely sold software that ranks news or social media posts by sentiment. This is losing value in the face of increasingly sophisticated NLP models, which have been spurred by tech advances and falling cloud computing costs. The breakthrough came in 2018 when developers released the source code behind NLP ""transfer learning"", which allowed a model to be pre-trained on one dataset of words and then put to work on another, saving time and money. Google's AI team has since released the code behind several cutting-edge models pre-trained on ever-larger datasets. Developers of current systems say they crunch tens of thousands of words at lightning speeds, extracting patterns and quantifying their degree of relation to certain significant ""seed"" words, phrases and ideas, as set by the user. MAN AHL's Marinov sees merit in tonal analysis but has not used it yet, focusing for now on clues hidden in written text. This can be anything from comparing annual reports over time to look for subtle changes not obvious to the reader, to quantifying something as intangible as corporate culture. Few investors have tried to formally measure corporate culture in the past even though it is critical for long-term performance, especially in the hot ESG investment sphere of environmental, social and governance considerations. Man AHL's model can scan executives' comments to look for words or phrases that demonstrate a ""goal-driven"" culture, as well searching through employee reviews on careers website Glassdoor. Kai Wu, founder of hedge fund Sparkline Capital, has created ""personality profiles"" for companies to measure their adherence to certain cultural values. He selects seed words he believes reflect such values. His NLP model then reduces vast volumes of words to small numbers of words with similar meanings, with findings expressed numerically. Using his NLP model on management commentary and employee reviews, he found that firms with ""idiosyncratic"" cultures such as Apple, Southwest Airlines and Costco outperformed. Conversely, U.S. businesses exhibiting ""toxicity"" - where employees use idioms as specific as ""good ol' boys club"" and ""dog eat dog"" - have vastly underperformed, Wu said. 'THERE ARE NO RULES' Funds without the resources to hire data scientists to build their own NLP tools can buy in analysis from third-party firms, like those Schnidman advises - fintech Aiera and tonal analytics provider Helios Life Enterprises - which sell their services to clients such as hedge funds. However, Wu at Sparkline is of the mind that funds should get NLP-derived data ""as close to raw as possible"", with in-house models preferable. The technology faces other challenges, and getting it right can be time-consuming. Dutch manager NN Investment Partners employs a mix of third-party data and its own models, some still in the research phase. One project is training a model to find words that predict bond default rates, said Sebastiaan Reinders, NNIP's head of investment science. That has initially required portfolio managers to examine long lists of phrases to manually label them as positive or negative, though. Most models are focused on English, and developers could face a difficult task adapting them to read accurately sentiment from people from different cultures who speak other languages. Plus, executives are cottoning on. When George Mussalli, chief investment officer at U.S.-based PanAgora Asset Management, told a biotech firm boss that his fund's AI scanned executives' comments for watchwords, the person asked for a list to help his business rank higher. Mussalli rejected the request but said documents like earnings call transcripts were increasingly ""well-scripted"", undermining their value. Yet Man Group's Marinov reckons executives will ultimately prove no match for machines that improve with more data. ""There are no rules, it's like a self-driving car that learns as it goes,"" he added. ""So in many cases it's impossible to give the executive a list of watchwords.""

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Burberry names Versace's Akeroyd as new CEO¬"(Alliance News) -Â Stocks in London are set to open slightly lower on Wednesday, failing to follow positive momentum from New York overnight. Meanwhile, the pound eased in early trade after the UK inflation rate unexpectedly softened in September. In early UK company news, Burberry appointed Versace's Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive, and Deliveroo raised its full-year gross transaction value guidance. IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open down 6.03 points, or 0.1%, at 7,211.50 on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 closed up 13.70 points, or 0.2%, at 7,217.53 on Tuesday. The pound softened early Wednesday after data showed the UK inflation rate eased a touch last month. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, Head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the Financial Times. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" Sterling was quoted at USD1.3791 following the inflation data, soft on USD1.3800 at the London equities close on Tuesday. Also due on Wednesday is eurozone inflation, at 1000 BST. The flash reading of 1.9% year-on-year growth in consumer prices is expected to be confirmed. The euro traded at USD1.1638 early Wednesday, essentially flat from USD1.1640 late Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JPY114.49 from JPY114.23. In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.1%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong shot up 1.2%.

Shares in Netflix slipped 1.4% post-market despite the video streaming service reporting a rise in earnings and subscriber growth as it hailed recent hit show 'Squid Game'.

Third quarter net income was up 84% at USD1.45 billion from USD790 million the year before with diluted earnings per share of USD3.19, up from USD1.74 a year ago. Meanwhile, United Airlines shares rose 2.3% after-hours after swinging to net income of USD473 million in the three months to September 30 from a loss of USD1.84 billion the same period a year before. Oanda's Halley said: ""US earnings will continue to drive sentiment globally ex-China, and as long as they remain upbeat, so should equity markets this week."" In early UK company news, British luxury fashion brand Burberry found a replacement for Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti in the form of ex-Alexander McQueen boss Jonathan Akeroyd. Akeroyd, currently CEO of Milan-based Gianni Versace, will join Burberry to take up the same role on April 1, 2022. In his time at Versace, he has ""reorganised and accelerated growth at the iconic Italian fashion house"", Burberry said. He was previously CEO of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen. Gobbetti will leave Burberry at the end of 2021, and Gerry Murphy will chair the executive committee from this date until Akeroyd arrives. Chilean miner Antofagasta backed its 2021 copper production guidance, but moderated warned output is set to dip next year. Copper output in the third quarter was 181,100 tonnes, 1.5% higher than in the previous quarter on higher production at Centinela, partly offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres. Cash costs before by-product credits in the third quarter were USD1.79 per pound, being 2 cents higher than the second quarter as the energy crisis pushed up input prices. For the full-year, guidance for copper production of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes was unchanged. For 2022 however, Antofagasta now expects output of 660,000 to 690,000 tonnes. ""Since we last reported, there has been no material rainfall at our operations and as we head into the summer months, we do not expect any rain until the next rainy season, which begins in June next year,"" said Chief Executive Ivan Arriagada. ""The construction of the desalination plant at Los Pelambres is on track for completion in H2 2022 and we now anticipate group production in 2022 to be between 660,000 and 690,000 tonnes reflecting the previously advised production tonnes at risk at Los Pelambres due to the weather, and lower grades at Centinela concentrates."" Cybersecurity firm Avast backed its outlook after third-quarter growth. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 rose 3.0% to USD232.7 million, and was up 5.6% on an organic basis. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation edged up 0.8% to USD127.0 million. ""Billings growth accelerated through the quarter, and we expect H2 billings growth of mid to high single digits,"" the company said. Avast reaffirmed its full-year outlook for revenue to be at the upper end of 6% to 8% growth, and a broadly flat adjusted Ebitda margin percentage. Deliveroo raised its outlook following a ""strong"" third quarter performance despite the lifting of most remaining coronavirus restrictions in the UK during the period. The food delivery firm reported annual growth in gross transaction value of 54% in the third quarter of 2021 at GBP1.59 billion, describing orders as ""resilient"" despite lockdown restrictions being eased in the UK. It did note a ""modest"" reduction in average order value, with this slipping 6% year-on-year to GBP21.4 from GBP22.8. On the back of this, Deliveroo raised its full-year gross transaction value guidance to growth of 60% to 70%, versus prior guidance of 50% to 60%. Its margin outlook was unchanged, seen in a range of 7.50% to 7.75%. ""While we are mindful of current and potential macroeconomic disruptions and uncertainties, we expect further strong performance in the remainder of the year and we are increasing our full-year GTV growth guidance,"" said Founder & Chief Executive Will Shu. Gold was quoted at USD1,775.92 an ounce early Wednesday, slightly higher than USD1,772.17 on Tuesday. Brent oil was trading at USD84.50 a barrel, easing from USD84.64 late Tuesday.

Big fossil fuel producers' plans far exceed climate targets, U.N. says¬"* UN report points to big rises in coal, gas, oil production * Report findings based on analysis of 15 major economies * Publication comes ahead of crucial UN climate talks in Scotland By Nina Chestney LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Major economies will produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than is consistent with meeting climate goals set in the 2015 Paris accord to curb global warming, the United Nations and researchers said on Wednesday. The U.N. Environment Programme's (UNEP) annual production gap report measures the difference between governments' planned production of fossil fuels and production levels which are consistent with meeting the temperature limits set in Paris. Under the pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting average temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to attempt to limit them even further to 1.5C. The report, which analysed 15 major fossil fuel producers, found they plan to produce, in total, around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting the degree of warming to 1.5C, and 45% more than is consistent with 2C. The size of that gap has not declined much since UNEP's 2020 report, it added. The countries analysed in the report were Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Representatives from nearly 200 countries will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 for climate talks to strengthen action to tackle global warming under the 2015 Paris Agreement. FOSSIL FUELS Despite efforts to strengthen climate targets, most major oil and gas producers plan to increase production until 2030 or beyond, while several major coal producers plan to continue or even increase output, the report said. The plans of the 15 countries analysed envisage fossil fuel production increasing until at least 2040. This would lead to about 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas in 2030 than what is required in order to curb the rate of global warming to 1.5C. Of the three fuels, gas production is projected to increase the most between 2020 and 2040, based on the governments’ plans. The International Energy Agency said in May that investors should not fund new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world is to hit net zero emissions by mid-century. ""The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,"" said Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author of the new report. The report was produced by UNEP, as well as experts from the Stockholm Environment Institute, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and think-tanks E3G and ODI.

UPDATE 1-Morrisons shareholders back CD&R's $10 bln takeover¬"(Adds details) LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Shareholders in British supermarket group Morrisons on Tuesday approved a 7 billion pound ($9.7 billion) agreed takeover offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Morrisons said the requisite majorities of shareholders backed the deal at the meeting held both physically at its Bradford, northern England, headquarters and virtually. CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, won an auction for Morrisons on Oct. 2, bidding a penny a share more than a consortium led by Softbank owned Fortress Investment Group. CD&R's winning bid of 287 pence a share represented a hefty 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June. The deal is now expected to complete on Oct. 27. ""We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead,"" said Leahy.

LIVE MARKETS-The two sides of Britain PLC in a chart¬"* European stocks, Wall Street futures flat * Nestle shines, Kering, ASML Holding disappoint * Miners worst performers across STOXX 600 * UK inflation slows in September * Bundesbank's Weidmann quits * Oct 20 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com THE TWO SIDES OF BRITAIN PLC IN A CHART (0959 GMT) A revival in value, banks and energy stocks, coupled with a weaker sterling is boosting interest for UK large-caps. But on the other hand, growing post-Brexit challenges and the prospect of higher interest rates weigh on UK domestic companies. As a result, the exporter-focused FTSE 100 -- which makes about 60% of its revenue abroad -- is thriving, while UK mid caps are lagging behind. Barclays sees rising risks for domestic recovery weighing on the FTSE 250 -- heavy on industrials, discretionary, staples, and diversified financials, all sectors that could be pressured by a slowdown in the UK economy. ""We see challenges from Brexit compounding COVID-related supply issues and an unfavourable mix of early fiscal and monetary tightening,"" Barclays says. (Joice Alves) ****** EUROPEAN SHARES SEEK DIRECTION AFTER MIXED BATCH OF EARNINGS (0750 GMT) European shares are edging up as traders digest a batch of mixed earnings results. The pan-European STOXX 600 started the day in the red but it has gained some grounds and is now 0.1% higher. Strong results from Swiss food giant Nestle, which raised its sales outlook, were partially offset by underwhelming reports from French luxury group Kering and Dutch semiconductor company ASML. Kering tumbles 4% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of COVID recovery, particularly in Asia. London blue chips are little changed as fears that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in two weeks persist as the unexpected slowdown in inflation in September is seen as temporary. Shares in Antofagasta slip to the bottom of the FTSE after its Q3 production report. Other miners -- Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American -- are among the worst performers in London on lower metal prices. (Joice Alves) **** MARGIN PRESSURES (0718 GMT) Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Sujata Rao) ***** INFLATION DATA, EARNINGS FOR BREAKFAST (0640 GMT) Futures are pointing to a start of the day in the red for European bourses amid cautious about the global economic outlook with rising inflation expectations driving the market. Data showed this morning, British inflation slowed unexpectedly in September but the decline probably marked a temporary respite for consumers and the Bank of England is expected to address the acceleration by raising interests rates, possibly in two weeks. In the corporate front, as a slew of companies are reporting their earnings, traders are getting some much-needed guidance. For instance, Nestle, Deliveroo and Swiss drugmaker Roche upgraded guidance after strong Q3 results. {nL8N2RG0RX] But supply chain disruptions is biting. Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel reported weaker-than-expected quarterly core earnings, hit by high costs of raw material and supply chain disruptions.

THG notes CEO Moulding's loan collateral share pledge dropped¬"(Alliance News) - THG PLC on Wednesday said that shares held by Chief Executive Matthew Moulding are no longer subject to a pledge and used as collateral for a loan. The Manchester-based online retail platform - better known as the Hut Group - is looking to rebuild investor confidence, after a disastrous capital markets day early last week resulted in a hefty share price slide and left analysts with more questions than answers. In a regulatory filing in September, THG said a loan was made by Barclays Bank PLC to FIC Shareco Ltd, an entity associated with Moulding. The loan was secured by about 180 million THG shares. They included 28.4 million held by CEO Moulding, 9.8 million belonging to Jodie Moulding and 144.6 million attributed to FIC Shareco itself. The move did not reduce Moulding's holding in THG. THG said on Wednesday: ""The company today announces that on 19 October 2021, it received notification from Matthew & Jodie Moulding and FIC Shareco that the foregoing pledge of ordinary shares under the FIC Shareco loan facility had been released in full."" It means that no shares held by CEO Moulding are subject to any collateral or stock pledge. ""Matthew & Jodie Moulding and FIC Shareco also confirmed to the company that there was no disposal or other dealing in any ordinary shares, and nor will there be any such dealing, in connection with securing the release of this pledge,"" THG said. The move follows THG announcing Monday that Moulding plans to give up his golden share, ""in furtherance of good corporate governance"". The special share allows Moulding to veto any takeover bid for three years. It has been unpopular with investors and prevents THG from joining the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 despite a market capitalisation of GBP3.99 billion. The stock was up 0.6% at 327.40 pence each in London on Wednesday morning. THG would be shoe-in for inclusion in the mid-cap index, where only a handful of firms have a chunkier market value, including the likes of cybersecurity firm Darktrace PLC and budget carrier easyJet PLC. Getting into the FTSE 100 would be more of a stretch. At GBP4.2 billion, Royal Mail PLC and ITV PLC, the smallest blue-chip stocks, still have slightly higher market values than THG.

UPDATE 1-Rio Tinto plans $7.5 bln spend to halve carbon emissions by 2030¬"(Adds detail) MELBOURNE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday a $7.5 billion plan to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, a reduction three times greater than its previous target. The target, based on 2018 emissions, will apply to Rio's direct and indirect emissions. Rio Tinto did not change its plan for scope 3 emissions - that is the emissions of its steel making customers - which will stay at a reduction of 30% by 2030. The miner is also targeting a 15% cut to emissions by 2025, five years earlier than previously.

Rio also said it expects to rapidly deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar and wind power generation in the Pilbara to replace gas-fired power generation. It also intends to decarbonise its Boyne Island and Tomago aluminium smelters, which will require an estimated 5 GW of solar and wind power generation. Rio Tinto's aluminium business accounts for 70% of Rio's scope 1 and 2 emissions.

UPDATE 4-From Italian glitz to British rainwear: Versace boss joins Burberry¬"* UK luxury label picks Briton to succeed Marco Gobbetti * Akeroyd led McQueen turnaround before joining Versace * Will join Burberry on April 1, 2022 * Burberry's shares flat (Adds details, analyst comment) By Sarah Young and Paul Sandle LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British fashion house Burberry has named Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive officer from next April, poaching the boss of Milan-based Versace and former Alexander McQueen head to succeed Marco Gobbetti. The appointment ends months of uncertainty at the 165-year-old group, which had been searching for a replacement for Gobbetti since June, when he announced his shock departure mid-way into a multi-year turnaround plan to take the brand further upmarket. However, the relatively long transition period means it will take time for Akeroyd to stamp his mark on Burberry. ""The timing of his start date suggests Burberry is unlikely to present an updated strategy until Q3/Q4 2022 at the earliest, thus delaying its turnaround even further,"" UBS analysts said in a note. Shares in Burberry, which have extended losses since the announcement of Gobbetti's departure and were trading down 19% on June levels, were up slightly on Wednesday. Burberry, known for its trench coats, trademark plaid and TB monogram, said Akeroyd, a 54-year-old Briton, was the right choice to build on its creative heritage. ""Jonathan is an experienced leader with a strong track record in building global luxury fashion brands and driving profitable growth,"" Burberry Chair Gerry Murphy said. Akeroyd accelerated growth during his five years at Italy's Versace and oversaw the sale of the house, known for its opulent, ostentatious style, to U.S. group Michael Kors, now known as Capri Holdings, in 2018. Versace's revenues rebounded in the latest quarter reported, with revenue of $240 million up 158% year on year and a return to profit after the COVID-19 impact a year earlier. However, its pre-pandemic annual sales of $843 million are still well below a $2 billion target set by Capri for the brand. Before joining Versace, Akeroyd led the successful relaunch of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen, part of French luxury giant Kering, from 2004-2016. Berenberg analysts said Akeroyd had ""lots of luxury CEO experience of leading houses - as well as brand turnarounds"". He would earn an annual salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million) plus bonuses, and would be granted cash and share payments worth about 6 million pounds for incentives he forfeits at Versace, Burberry said. Like other luxury brands, Burberry was hit by COVID-19, but it has recovered, driven by demand in Asia. It said in July its like-for-like sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven by new, younger fans of Riccardo Tisci, the designer who Gobbetti brought in to revitalise the brand and who investors are relieved is staying put. Gobbetti's departure was described as a personal decision to return to Italy, where he will lead the Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo. He will leave Burberry on Dec. 31. The group said Murphy would chair the executive committee for the four months until Akeroyd joins.

UPDATE 3-Rio Tinto announces bold $7.5 bln spend to halve carbon emissions by 2030¬"* Rio targets reducing emissions 15% by 2025, 50% by 2030 * Decarbonisation will focus on aluminium, iron ore divisions * Rio will double growth spend on minerals for energy transition (Adds detail, CEO comment, investor comment) MELBOURNE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday a $7.5 billion plan to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, a reduction three times greater than its previous target. As steel and iron ore producers continue their push to cut carbon emissions in line with global climate commitments by 2050, Rio said it sought to halve its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions - direct emissions by the company and certain types of indirect emissions, respectively - by the end of the decade. Rio brought forward its target to 2025 for a 15% reduction in emissions from 2018 levels, five years faster than it had previously targeted. ""It’s a massive shift but it’s the future for Rio Tinto,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told a media briefing ahead of an investor day conference and presentation. To meet this goal, Rio said it would double spending on growth in minerals critical to the energy transition to about $3 billion a year from 2023. Stausholm said Rio was also taking a number of ""tangible actions"" towards helping its customers reduce their emissions. The world's biggest iron ore miner said this month it is trialing new technology that would use biomass in place of coking coal in the steelmaking process to cut industry carbon emissions, and it has also said it is looking at hydrogen. But Rio did not commit to bigger reductions for its customer emissions, currently targeted at 30% by 2030. Rio's new targets blow past those of rival BHP Group , which targets reducing its operational emissions by 30% by 2030, but still falls short of Fortescue Metals Group's goals. “Rio Tinto has finally joined the party with some very ambitious emissions reduction targets, showing BHP and its shareholders what climate action for a diversified miner should look like,"" said activist investor the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. “While not as ambitious as Fortescue Metals Group’s net zero (operational) emissions by 2030, Rio Tinto has come a long way under Jakob Stausholm."" Rival Fortescue Metals Group committed earlier this month to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 from the operations of its steel making customers, by boosting hydrogen and green energy production to cut its carbon footprint. To decarbonise its Western Australian iron ore operations, Rio plans to deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar and wind power generation, replacing gas-fired power generation. It also intends to decarbonise its Boyne Island and Tomago aluminium smelters in Australia, which will require an estimated 5 GW of solar and wind power generation. Rio's aluminium business accounts for some 70% of its direct and indirect emissions. The reductions compare to a 2018 baseline of 32.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from Rio's share of operations.

""European markets have had a steadier and pretty uneventful day, trading quietly with little in the way of direction, with the FTSE 100, trading around the flat line, and FTSE 250 edging higher. The continued resilience in oil prices is continuing to act as a drag on the travel and leisure sector, with IAG the biggest faller, slipping to four-week lows, after Heathrow Airport said it would be hiking passenger charges for airlines using the hub,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. In the FTSE 100, Entain ended up 2.2% after suitor DraftKings deadline to make firm offer for the Ladbrokes owner has been extended to November 16. The Boston, Massachusetts-based sports betting firm said it will continue to engage in discussions with Entain and to conduct more substantive due diligence regarding its GBP16 billion offer.

Fresnillo gained 2.9% - the top blue-chip stock, while Polymetal International advanced 2.1%. Tesco closed up 1.8% after the supermarket chain said it was launching its first checkout-free high street store where shoppers can pick up their groceries and leave without the need for a till. It is the latest large retailer to open a store where checkouts are replaced by high-tech cameras designed to track the items shoppers place in their baskets. The firm's high street store trial, which it has called GetGo, launches in High Holborn in London on Tuesday. Amazon launched its first Amazon Go grocery shop in the UK in February, before expanding to five more sites, while Aldi opened its own till-free shop last month. At the other end of the large-caps, International Consolidated Airlines ended the worst performer, down 5.8%, after Berenberg downgraded the British Airways parent to Hold from Buy. In travel sector news, Heathrow will be allowed to raise passenger charges by up to 56% under plans announced by the UK aviation regulator. The Civil Aviation Authority is consulting on increasing the cap on the west London airport's price per passenger from GBP22 last year to between GBP24.50 and GBP34.40. It is proposing that the exact figure will depend on factors such as passenger demand and commercial revenue, with prices higher if Heathrow continues to struggle in those areas. The range is planned to come in effect from summer 2022, with an interim cap of GBP30 being introduced at the beginning of the year. The charges are ultimately paid by passengers as airlines add the cost to the price of tickets. Tui ended the worst FTSE 250 stock, down 5.5%. In the FTSE 250, Moneysupermarket.com ended the best performer, up 8.6%, after the price comparison site said revenue in the third quarter slipped but it continued to see strong gross margins. Revenue in the three months to September 30 dropped 10% on a year before to GBP76.4 million. Insurance revenue fell 10% to GBP41.3 million, while Home Services slumped 46% to GBP13.9 million. This was partially offset by 58% growth in the Money division to GBP19.7 million and 29% growth in Travel to GBP1.5 million. As a result, Moneysupermarket said it delivered a ""slightly higher quantum"" of gross profit than in third quarter of 2020. Looking ahead, the price comparison website said it expects full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in line with current market expectations. Meggitt shares ended flat after the UK government on Monday ordered a probe into the defence firm's GBP6.3 billion takeover offer by Parker-Hannifin Corp, on the grounds of national security concerns.

As a result, the UK Competition & Markets Authority is required to investigate the proposed transaction and submit a report by March 18, 2022. Meggitt on Tuesday said it looks forward to ""engaging constructively"" with the CMA and still expects the deal to complete in the third quarter of 2022. Elsewhere, Wise lost 6.9% after the international money transfer provider posted a hike in both revenue and transaction volumes, though the newly listed fintech firm saw its recent share price weakness continue. In its financial second quarter ended September, revenue increased 25% annually to GBP132.8 million from GBP105.9 million. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue was 7.5% higher from GBP123.5 million. The revenue figure was in line with expectations, Wise said, and the fintech put growth down to ""higher levels of volume seen in the quarter"". Looking ahead, Wise expects its take rate to be ""slightly lower"" in the second half of its financial year, which runs until March. It puts this down to price reductions. Take rate is a fee charged by the platform where a transaction is performed. Sterling was in the green against the dollar and euro as investors grew increasingly confident that the Bank of England will lift UK interest rates from historic lows, as early as November. The pound was quoted at USD1.3800 at the London equities close, up sharply from USD1.3711 at the close Monday. Versus the single currency, sterling hit an intraday high of EUR1.1873 - its highest level since February 2020. The move came after BoE Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned the central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures, the Financial Times reported. The governor spoke virtually on Sunday to a meeting of the G30 group of current and former central bankers. Bailey affirmed his view that recent spikes in inflation will be temporary. However, he warned that price increases could last until next year, citing the energy sector in particular. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the FT. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" The next BoE meeting is on November 4. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro explained; ""The pound is benefitting in recent days as markets are pricing in the higher chances of a Bank of England rate hike as early as November. In recent weeks, there has been increasing hints on rising inflation risks from the BoE... The rush to turn the page as quickly as possible on hydrocarbon use and reduced investment in oil, coal and gas production is mainly behind the latest price spike, overlaid with disruptions to energy production and the reluctance of exporting countries such as Russia and OPEC to increase oil and gas supplies in line with increased demand. ""As a result, inflation in the UK and in Europe is becoming increasingly protracted as the increased price of petrol moves further down to the products and services costs. Without a quick solution to the energy problem and without a significant reduction in prices, the Bank of England will be required to raise rates several more times during 2022. These changes in expectations are significant and support a rise in GBP against USD or EUR as the Fed or ECB are not expected to make such a quick policy reversal from stimulus to tightening."" The euro stood at USD1.1640 at the European equities close, up from USD1.1595 late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY114.23, soft from JPY114.28 late Monday. Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close as earnings season enters its second week. The DJIA was up 0.4%, the S&P 500 index up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%. On Wall Street, Travelers Cos was the best Dow performer, up 3.5%, after the insurance firm reported record net earned premiums but saw income drop.

TOP NEWS: Rio Tinto hopes to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030¬"(Alliance News) - Rio Tinto PLC on Wednesday said it is tripling its carbon emissions reduction target and is now hoping to cut those emissions by 50% by 2030. Shares in the FTSE 100-listed miner were down 2.5% in London on Wednesday morning at 4,923.50 pence each. It closed flat in Sydney at AUD98.08. By 2025, Rio is targeting a 15% reduction in its Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions, which is five years earlier than previously. The miner noted these targets are supported by around USD7.5 billion of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030. The reduction are based on a baseline from 2018 of 32.6 million tonnes. ""In recognition of the broader carbon footprint of the commodities it produces, Rio Tinto will accelerate its investment in R&D and development of technologies that enable its customers to decarbonise.  Working in partnership with governments, suppliers, customers, academia and others Rio Tinto will continue to develop technologies like ELYSISTM for carbon-free aluminium and multiple pathways to produce green steel,"" Rio explained. It continued: ""Rio Tinto can decarbonise, pursue growth and continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders due to its strong balance sheet, world-class assets and focus on capital discipline."" To support this growth the miner said its capital expenditure is likely to reach USD9 billion and USD10 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said: ""All our commodities are vital for the energy transition and continue to benefit from ongoing urbanisation. We have a clear pathway to decarbonise our business and are actively developing technologies that will enable our customers and our customers' customers to decarbonise."" Rio noted its medium-term Pilbara iron ore system capacity will sit between 345 and 360 million tonnes per year. Decarbonisation of Pilbara, Rio said, will be accelerated by targeting the ""rapid deployment"" of 1 gigwatts of wind and solar power, replacing natural gas power for plant and infrastructure and supporting early electrification of mining equipment. For its aluminium operations, Rio said it is progressing the switch at Boyne Island and Tomago smelters in Australia to renewable energy, which will require about 5GW of solar and wind power. ""We are able to do this, while continuing to provide attractive returns to our shareholders in line with our policy, because we have a strong balance sheet and world-class assets that deliver strong free cash flows through the cycle,"" Stausholm added.

UPDATE 1-Lufthansa, easyJet win EU court backing to buy Air Berlin assets ¬"(Adds details) By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa and British peer easyJet on Wednesday gained backing from Europe's second top court for their acquisitions of insolvent German carrier Air Berlin's assets four years ago. Lufthansa received the EU green light from the European Commission in 2017 to buy Air Berlin's subsidiary LGW in return for giving up some slots at Duesseldorf airport. In another deal, EasyJet secured unconditional clearance from the EU competition enforcer for the 40 million euros ($46.5 million) deal in 2017, which included some of Air Berlin's operations at Tegel airport, leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft and about 1,000 of Air Berlin's pilots and cabin crew. Polish rival LOT subsequently challenged the EU executive's decisions at the Luxembourg-based General Court. ""The General Court dismisses the actions of Polskie Linie Lotnicze 'LOT' against the Commission decisions authorising the mergers concerning the acquisition by easyJet and Lufthansa, respectively, of certain assets of the Air Berlin group,"" judges said. LOT can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) on points of law. The cases are T-240/18 Polskie Linie Lotnicze ""LOT"" v Commission and T-246/18 Polskie Linie Lotnicze ""LOT"" v Commission.

UPDATE 4-Rio Tinto announces bold $7.5 bln spend to halve carbon emissions by 2030; shares fall¬"* Rio targets reducing emissions 15% by 2025, 50% by 2030 * Decarbonisation will focus on aluminium, iron ore divisions * Rio will double growth spend on minerals for energy transition (Adds share price move, analyst comment) By Melanie Burton MELBOURNE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday a $7.5 billion plan to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, a reduction three times greater than its previous target, but shares fell as investors reacted to the higher spend. As steel and iron ore producers continue their push to cut carbon emissions in line with global climate commitments by 2050, Rio said it sought to halve its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions - direct emissions by the company and certain types of indirect emissions, respectively - by the end of the decade. Rio brought forward its target to 2025 for a 15% reduction in emissions from 2018 levels, five years faster than it had previously targeted. ""It’s a massive shift but it’s the future for Rio Tinto,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told a media briefing ahead of an investor day conference and presentation. To meet this goal, Rio will increase its power from renewables, boost research and development spending on decarbonisation pathways and also double spending on growth in minerals critical to the energy transition to about $3 billion a year from 2023. Shares were down 3.1 percent in London. ""This transition towards more spending at a time where the prospects for iron ore cash generation look challenged will further complicate this transition, as this will happen in a lower-yield environment,"" said RBC in a note. ""So although we think this is the right strategy it may take a significant amount of time for the shares to reflect this."" Rio raised its capital spending plans for 2022 to $8 billion from $7.5 billion and said it expected to spend $9 billion for 2023, and $10 billion for 2024. RBC had consensus estimates for 2023 spending at $6.8 billion and $5.8 billion for 2024. Stausholm said Rio was also taking a number of ""tangible actions"" towards helping its customers reduce their emissions. The world's biggest iron ore miner said this month it is trialing new technology that would use biomass in place of coking coal in the steelmaking process to cut industry carbon emissions, and it has also said it is looking at hydrogen. But Rio did not commit to bigger reductions for its customer emissions, currently targeted at 30% by 2030. Rio's new targets blow past those of rival BHP Group , which targets reducing its operational emissions by 30% by 2030, but still falls short of Fortescue Metals Group's goals. “Rio Tinto has finally joined the party with some very ambitious emissions reduction targets, showing BHP and its shareholders what climate action for a diversified miner should look like,"" said activist investor the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. Fortescue committed earlier this month to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 from the operations of its steel making customers, by boosting hydrogen and green energy production to cut its carbon footprint. To decarbonise its iron ore operations, Rio plans to deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar and wind power generation, replacing gas-fired power generation. It also intends to decarbonise its Boyne Island and Tomago aluminium smelters in Australia, which will require an estimated 5 GW of solar and wind power generation. Rio's aluminium business accounts for some 70% of its direct and indirect emissions. The reductions compare to a 2018 baseline of 32.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from Rio's share of operations. (Reporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru and Melanie Burton in Melbourne.

UPDATE 2-Rio Tinto plans $7.5 bln spend to halve carbon emissions by 2030¬"(Adds fresh quote, details) MELBOURNE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday a $7.5 billion plan to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, a reduction three times greater than its previous target. The target, based on 2018 emissions, will apply to Rio's direct and indirect emissions. Rio Tinto did not change its plan for scope 3 emissions - that is the emissions of its steel making customers - which will stay at a reduction of 30% by 2030. The miner is also targeting a 15% cut to emissions by 2025, five years earlier than previously. ""These targets are supported by around $7.5 billion of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030,"" it said. Rio also said it expects to rapidly deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar and wind power generation in the Pilbara to replace gas-fired power generation.

London close: FTSE finishes firmer while airlines descend¬"(Sharecast News) - London stocks were just above the waterline at the close on Tuesday, amid worries about rate hikes and as investors kept their wallets closed ahead of key US earnings. The FTSE 100 ended the session up 0.19% at 7,217.53, and the FTSE 250 was 0.37% firmer at 23,054.09. Sterling was also in the green, last trading 0.53% higher on the dollar at $1.3799, and gaining 0.34% against the euro to €1.1863. ""Airlines are on the back foot once again today, with sharp losses for IAG, Tui, and easyJet dragging down the wider FTSE index,"" said IG senior market analyst Joshua Mahony. ""Rising UK Covid-19 cases and the recent emergence of the 'Delta-plus' strain do provide a little cause for concern, although there remains hope that the successful vaccination drive should help protect the travel sector from any further disruptions."" Mahony also pointed to the news that the Civil Aviation Authority approved a ""whopping"" 53% rise in landing fees at Heathrow, making it the most expensive airport in the world. ""That is a particularly difficult pill to swallow for airlines that have been hoping to raise prices in a bid to improve margins and regain lost lockdown earnings."" In economic news, it emerged that the government was looking at linking mortgages to compulsory green improvements to homes. According to the Times, the government wanted mortgage lenders to disclose the energy efficiency of the homes they lend for, with targets set to improve the insulation of the buildings in their portfolios. Under the planned rules, lenders would need to get properties up to a 'C' Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating, with mandatory targets possible if the home building industry failed to improve standards. In equity markets, British Airways and Iberia owner IAG descended 5.78% after a downgrade to 'hold' from 'buy' at Berenberg. Gambling firm 888 was on the back foot by 2.07%, after it said it would take a $10m hit to profits after its Dutch business stopped operations from the start of October because of changes to gaming rules. On the upside, Pearson was ahead 2.54% after an upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell' at Berenberg and an upgrade to 'neutral' from 'underperform' at Credit Suisse. Hikma rose 2.77% after an upgrade to 'overweight' at Morgan Stanley, while precious metals miners Fresnillo and Polymetal were ahead 2.85% and 2.08% respectively, as gold prices rose. Elsewhere, Bellway advanced 1.58% after the housebuilder increased its final dividend by almost two-thirds as it reported a 72% increase in annual profit and a solid order book.

US housing starts and permits not as weak as they look, economists say¬"(Sharecast News) - Homebuilders in the US broke ground on fewer homes last month, although weakness was centred on the multi-family segment. According to the Department of Commerce, in seasonally adjusted terms, the annual rate of new home starts in the US dropped at a month-on-month pace of 1.6% in September to reach 1.56m. That was well beneath the 1.61m pace anticipated by economists. However, starts for single family homes were in fact steady at a clip of about 1.08m. Versus a year ago on the other hand, the pace of total housing starts was 7.4% higher. The number of new permits issued also undershot the consensus, dropping by 7.7% to reach an annual pace of 1.589m (consensus: 1.67m). Yet here too, weakness was driven by the multi-family segment. ""Stepping back from the noise, the trends in single-family permits and starts are running above the pace implied by the new home sales numbers, likely because inventory is still low and homebuilders want to capitalize on rising prices,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Eventually, construction activity will moderate relative to new home sales, but probably not for a few months, and in the meantime new sales are likely to pick up, given rising mortgage applications since mid-year."""¬Tue, 19th Oct 2021 15:36¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/us-housing-starts-and-permits-not-as-weak-as-they-look-economists-say-wur4lgiwfd8xuub.html

""The proposed equity raise has been unsuccessful and Salt Lake Potash have announced a voluntary administration of the company as at 20 October 2021,"" FTSE 250-listed Sequoia Economic said. Sequoia's investment in Salt Lake represented 1.9% of its net asset value on September 30. Sequoia added: ""The investment adviser had been developing a contingency plan should the funding gap not be addressed. This contingency plan has now been activated in full alignment with the lender group. The lender group has appointed KordaMentha, a leading Australian restructuring and advisory firm, as receivers for the lender group."" Martin Jones, Tom Birch and Hayden White of KPMG have been named as voluntary administrators. Under Australian laws, the receivers KordaMentha act for the benefit of a company's lenders. They may undertake trade sales, debt recovery or other restructuring work. Salt Lake's receivers said they will ""commence a process to market the company and its assets for sale and recapitalisation opportunities in the coming weeks"". Sequoia noted that the total amounted invested in the Lake Way project ""materially exceeds"" the debt. However, the investor noted a similar potash project with similar ramp-up issues to Lake Way recently achieved full production. The voluntary administrators, meanwhile, on Wednesday said Salt Lake's director resolved that the company was insolvent or likely to become insolvent ""at some future time"". Sequoia added: ""Whilst it is too early and speculative to comment on the eventual recovery percentage of our investment, our senior secured position should position us strongly in the restructuring process.""

LIVE MARKETS-European shares seek direction after mixed batch of earnings¬Oct 20 - Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of markets brought to you by Reuters reporters. You can share your thoughts with us at markets.research@thomsonreuters.com EUROPEAN SHARES SEEK DIRECTION AFTER MIXED BATCH OF EARNINGS (0750 GMT) European shares are edging up as traders digest a batch of mixed earnings results. The pan-European STOXX 600 started the day in the red but it has gained some grounds and is now 0.1% higher. Strong results from Swiss food giant Nestle, which raised its sales outlook, were partially offset by underwhelming reports from French luxury group Kering and Dutch semiconductor company ASML. Kering tumbles 4% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of COVID recovery, particularly in Asia. London blue chips are little changed as fears that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in two weeks persist as the unexpected slowdown in inflation in September is seen as temporary. Shares in Antofagasta slip to the bottom of the FTSE after its Q3 production report. Other miners -- Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American -- are among the worst performers in London on lower metal prices. (Joice Alves) **** MARGIN PRESSURES (0718 GMT) Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Sujata Rao) ***** INFLATION DATA, EARNINGS FOR BREAKFAST (0640 GMT) Futures are pointing to a start of the day in the red for European bourses amid cautious about the global economic outlook with rising inflation expectations driving the market. Data showed this morning, British inflation slowed unexpectedly in September but the decline probably marked a temporary respite for consumers and the Bank of England is expected to address the acceleration by raising interests rates, possibly in two weeks. In the corporate front, as a slew of companies are reporting their earnings, traders are getting some much-needed guidance. For instance, Nestle, Deliveroo and Swiss drugmaker Roche upgraded guidance after strong Q3 results. {nL8N2RG0RX] But supply chain disruptions is biting. Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel reported weaker-than-expected quarterly core earnings, hit by high costs of raw material and supply chain disruptions.

Venerable trusts Scottish Investment and JPMorgan Global to merge¬"(Alliance News) - Scottish Investment Trust PLC will be folded into JPMorgan Global Growth & Income PLC after the two 134-year-old companies agreed a merger. Under the combination deal announced on Wednesday, the assets of Scottish Investment Trust will be transferred into JGGI, creating an investment company with net assets in excess of GBP1.2 billion. The enlarged JGGI will be big enough to enter the FTSE 250 index of London mid-cap stocks, said Chair Nigel Wightman. The two companies both were founded in 1887. Combining them is expected produce economies of scale, a higher profile and improved share liquidity. JGGI will continue to be managed by JPMorgan Funds Ltd and will keep its existing investment strategy and dividend policy. That strategy is a high-conviction portfolio of about 50 to 90 stocks, selected using a bottom-up approach. Wightman is stepping down as JGGI chair at the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday next week, succeeded by Tristan Hillgarth. ""The transaction brings together two of the oldest investment trusts in the sector, both incorporated in 1887, and creates a vehicle that can continue to serve shareholders' interests for many years to come,"" Wightman said. Explaining the decision to merge with JGGI, Scottish Investment Trust Chair James Will said: ""The board undertook a lengthy and robust review process and considered a wide range of options for the company. Ultimately, the proposal to combine The Scottish Investment Trust with JPMorgan Global Growth & Income was considered the most compelling outcome for shareholders."" He added: ""JGGI offers a style-agnostic total return approach that has delivered index-beating performance, and it distributes an attractive level of dividend to investors."" The investment management change is expected to occur by mid-January, with the merger completed in the first quarter. Scottish Investment Trust shares were up 7.2% on Wednesday at 807.25 pence. It has a market capitalisation of about GBP500 million. JGGI was down 0.6% at 446.33p. It's market cap is about GBP700 million.

In a report this week, Saira Malik, CIO, head of global equities at Nuveen, said that factors such as COVID-19's Delta variant, supply chains, inflation, and the end of federal stimulus, will likely keep third quarter earnings growth rates for S&P 500 companies in the 30% to 35% range, down from the first quarter when they eventually topped 50%. ""In fact, earnings revisions for the third quarter are the lowest of 2021 so far, with estimates increasing by a modest 3%-4% since the end of June, versus double-digit percentage increases in the previous two quarters,"" the report said. ""Guidance has been more moderate, too; nearly half of companies reporting so far have issued negative (earnings per share) guidance."" Still, Nuveen noted that trailing and forward-looking valuations for the S&P 500 have fallen 10% to 20% from first quarter levels, which should allow equities to grind higher even in the face of decelerating earnings growth. ""The best-positioned companies are those that can build inventories and protect/grow their margins until the headwinds created by inflation and global supply chain disruptions begin to dissipate,"" it added.

Danone shares have been in a downward trend all session, and are now falling about 3%, the worst performance of the blue chips which make the EURO STOXX 50 index. The group's Q3 earnings themselves - the group stuck to its 2021 guidance - don't seem so much to blame for the poor performance. ""It's the comments about the inflation and the supply chain"", argued Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition. CFO Juergen Esser told analysts in a conference call that inflation costs were expected to rise at least 8% in 2022 and said shipping in Asia was under high tension. But inflation is also seen impacting the price of milk, ingredients and packaging. While many strategists are trying to shift their portfolios toward assets like commodities or financials stocks which typically thrive when prices rise, Danone seems to be battling precisely on the front line of inflation, perhaps not the most comfortable place to be. As Citi analysts point out in their rating about Danone, some of the risks to their target price of 66 euros lays in ""the wholesale price of milk, as dairy inputs equal about 15% of sales"". Price of PET resin, which is used to make containers for food and drinks, is also an important cost.

That said, over the past three months, multi-day winning streaks have led to sudden setbacks: From late-July into early-October, NQcv1 has struggled in the wake of a three-to-five-day run of gains. There have been six such streaks over this period, and on average, NQcv1 then sold off nearly 3% over the next four trading days or so. NQcv1 last rose more than five-straight days with a seven-day win streak in mid-June. The futures are also rapidly nearing resistance hurdles in the form of the 76.4%/78.6% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Sept. 7-Oct. 4 decline, in the 15,386.54/15,415.88 area, and the Sept. 27 high, at 15,399.25. This resistance should provide an interesting test for the futures, especially given the current win streak, and that the Nasdaq has been relying on its largest caps to underpin gains. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures are also on track for a 5th-straight day of gains. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 index, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE FANG+TM Index have all risen four-straight days.

UPDATE 1-Tohoku Electric buys six LNG cargoes from BP in short-term deal¬"(Changes dateine, adds graphic, Japan's latest LNG imports) By Aaron Sheldrick and Marwa Rashad TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Japan's Tohoku Electric Power has signed a contract with BP for six cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), two trading sources told Reuters, avoiding paying record high prices on the spot market for short-term supplies. The cargoes will be delivered in the first half of next year and are priced at 20% of Brent crude, the sources said, translating to about $17 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at current prices. That is less than half the prevailing spot price in Asia of $38.50/mmBtu <LNG-AS>, a record high as an energy crisis engulfs much of the Northern Hemisphere, driving a rally in oil and pushing coal prices to historic highs. ""They should be happy with that price,"" said one of the trading sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A Tohoku Electric spokesperson said the utility would not discuss its fuel procurement strategy. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Japanese LNG buyers have said they would target short-term supply agreements when they need to top up long-term contractual cargoes of the superchilled fuel. Last winter they frantically competed with Chinese and South Korean buyers for cargoes in a tight spot market as freezing conditions hit the region for weeks on end, sending Japanese electricity prices to global records. This winter, the regional crunch looks set to be played out on a global scale as Europe struggles for gas supplies, benchmark prices in the United States are around seven-year highs and economic growth in China is squeezed by power shortages. Tohoku's deal also underlines the absence of Japanese buyers in the spot market as they rely on long-term contract supplies of LNG, where the average price was just over $10 mmBtu in August, according to official trade figures. Japan imported 5.41 million tonnes of LNG in September, figures from the government showed on Wednesday, down 17% from a year earlier, another sign Japanese buyers have avoided the spot market, traders said. LNG inventories in Japan are also seasonally above average, but with electricity prices rising in recent weeks, Tokyo-based executives and traders say they are concerned about another winter of high prices and the threat of blackouts.

"LONDON BRIEFING: ""Temporary respite"" in UK inflation puts BoE in bind"¬"(Alliance News) - The annual UK inflation rate eased a touch last month, data showed on Wednesday, but still remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. Month-on-month, prices rose 0.3%, again slowing from August's 0.7% rise. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, Head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year."" The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the Financial Times. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" A separate release from the ONS on Wednesday showed producer price growth picked up in September. Output prices rose 6.7% on the year to September, accelerating from 6.0% in August. Input price growth also ticked up, to 11.4% from 11.2%. Lloyds Bank commented that the easing of price pressure in the UK won't last. ""We predicted a fall to 3.0% year-on-year. It will be a temporary respite from the march up to and potentially beyond 4% in the coming months. The increase in the energy price cap will pull inflation higher in October, with a further significant rise likely next April as a result of soaring wholesale gas prices,"" Lloyds said. ""That means that inflation seems set to remain around 4% into the second quarter of next year. It will present the [Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England] with a difficult policy trade-off between supporting the economy and tackling inflation."" Added Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, about BoE policymakers: ""It could take a bit longer for the requisite number of doves to sheepishly convert into hawks. This latest moderation in inflation will also pour cold water on the case for immediately tighter monetary policy.""

China's new-home prices fell for the first time in six years last month, data showed on Wednesday, as the property sector struggles after a government clampdown, while a default at several major developers added to contagion concerns from the Evergerande crisis. The latest reading follows official figures showing the real estate and construction industries shrank in the third quarter for the first time since the early stage of the pandemic, which acted as a huge drag on the world's number two economy. Figures on Wednesday showed that the cost of new homes in 70 large and medium-sized cities saw a small decrease in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said without giving a precise percentage, though Bloomberg calculations found they dropped by around 0.1%. That represents the first drop since April 2015. Prices in the secondary market slipped 0.2%, a second monthly fall, Bloomberg said. North Korea confirmed a rocket test a day earlier, saying it had tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile. North Korean state news agency KCNA reported Pyongyang test-launched a ""new type"" of rocket which it said would help enhance the country's defence technology and the navy's underwater operational capability. Photos published by KCNA showed a small rocket with a presumably small range. This, paired with the absence of leader Kim Jong Un at the launch, is why experts do not consider the test a groundbreaking development for North Korea's missile programme.

Chilean miner Antofagasta backed its 2021 copper production guidance, but warned output is set to dip next year. Copper output in the third quarter was 181,100 tonnes, 1.5% higher than in the previous quarter on higher production at Centinela, partly offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres. Cash costs before by-product credits in the third quarter were USD1.79 per pound, being 2 cents higher than the second quarter as the energy crisis pushed up input prices. For the full-year, guidance for copper production of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes was unchanged. For 2022 however, Antofagasta now expects output of 660,000 to 690,000 tonnes. Cybersecurity firm Avast backed its outlook after third-quarter growth. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 rose 3.0% to USD232.7 million, and was up 5.6% on an organic basis. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation edged up 0.8% to USD127.0 million. ""Billings growth accelerated through the quarter, and we expect H2 billings growth of mid to high single digits,"" the company said. Avast reaffirmed its full-year outlook for revenue to be at the upper end of 6% to 8% growth, and a broadly flat adjusted Ebitda margin percentage. Avast didn't comment on its impending acquisition by the US's NortonLifelock other than to say that its forecast doesn't include transaction costs or accounting impacts of the merger. COMPANIES - MAIN MARKET AND AIM Deliveroo raised its outlook following a ""strong"" third quarter performance despite the lifting of most remaining coronavirus restrictions in the UK during the period. The food delivery firm reported annual growth in gross transaction value of 54% in the third quarter of 2021 at GBP1.59 billion, describing orders as ""resilient"" despite lockdown restrictions being eased in the UK. It did note a ""modest"" reduction in average order value, with this slipping 6% year-on-year to GBP21.4 from GBP22.8. On the back of this, Deliveroo raised its full-year gross transaction value guidance to growth of 60% to 70%, versus prior guidance of 50% to 60%. Its margin outlook was unchanged, seen in a range of 7.50% to 7.75%. ""While we are mindful of current and potential macroeconomic disruptions and uncertainties, we expect further strong performance in the remainder of the year and we are increasing our full-year GTV growth guidance,"" said Founder & Chief Executive Will Shu. COMPANIES - GLOBAL Roche raised its full-year guidance as the pharmaceutical firm benefited from persistent high demand for the use of its coronavirus testing kits. The Basel, Switzerland-based company reported sales for the first nine months of the year ended September 30 of CHF46.68 billion, up 8% year-on-year from CHF43.98 billion. In the Diagnostics Division, sales grew 18% in the third quarter and 39% in the first nine months due to high demand for Covid-19 tests, a strong recovery in the base business, and Roche's newly launched diagnostics platforms.

Facebook fined £50m by UK regulator over Giphy deal¬"(Sharecast News) - Social media giant Facebook has been fined £50.5m for failing to prove it was complying with the competition regulator during a probe into the firm's takeover of GIF sharing platform Giphy. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) started the investigation into the £290m deal in June last year over concerns about a ""substantial lessening of competition"". Giphy's user-uploaded library of animated images is already integrated and used widely by Facebook's family of social media apps but can also be used on other platforms such as Twitter. As part of the investigation, the social network was ordered to keep the two businesses separate until a conclusion was reached under an initial enforcement order (IEO), meaning Giphy should have been allowed to compete as an individual entity. The CMA said Facebook ""deliberately"" refused to supply information proving that it was complying with the IEO. Separately, the CMA has fined Facebook £500,000 for changing its chief compliance officer on two separate occasions without seeking consent. ""We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations,"" said CMA senior director of mergers Joel Bamford. ""This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law."""¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 10:43¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/facebook-fined-163-50m-by-uk-regulator-over-giphy-deal-ljis6e5z1xji5sk.html

UPDATE 2-UK supermarket Morrisons' shareholders back CD&R's $10 bln takeover¬"* CD&R won Oct. 2 auction for supermarket group * Deal expected to complete on Oct. 27 (Adds detail) By James Davey LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Shareholders in supermarket group Morrisons on Tuesday approved a 7 billion pound ($9.7 billion) offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), bringing the curtain down on Britain's most fiercely contested takeover this year. Morrisons said the requisite majorities of shareholders backed the deal, which had been recommended by the board, at meetings held both physically at its Bradford, northern England headquarters and virtually. CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, won an auction for Morrisons on Oct. 2, bidding a penny a share more than a consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group. CD&R's winning bid of 287 pence a share represented a hefty 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June. Formal completion of the deal, expected on Oct. 27, will conclude a six-month battle to buy Morrisons, Britain's fourth-biggest grocer and one of the country's biggest food producers. It will end Morrisons' 54-year run as a publicly-listed company and see the ultimate decisions on the group's future shift from Bradford to the New York home of CD&R. Morrisons, which started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda in annual revenue. The battle for Morrisons has been the most high-profile amid a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets. CD&R has committed to retaining Morrisons' Bradford base and its existing management team, led by CEO David Potts. It has also said it will execute the supermarket chain's existing strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and maintain staff pay rates. Those commitments are not legally binding, however. ""We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead,"" said Leahy, who is expected to succeed Andrew Higginson as Morrisons' chairman. ""The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners."" Morrisons is the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity after a buyout of No. 3 player Asda, by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital, completed in February. Potts, who started his retail career at Tesco as a 16-year-old shelf stacker, will make more than 10 million pounds from selling his Morrisons shares to CD&R. Chief Operating Officer Trevor Strain will pocket about 4 million pounds.

De Beers diamond sales fall in eighth cycle¬(Sharecast News) - Rough-diamond sales by Anglo American's majority-owned De Beers Group fell 6.1% in the eighth sales cycle of 2021 compared with the previous cycle, but up year on year, the company said on Wednesday. Anglo said US consumer demand for diamond jewellery continued to perform strongly ahead of the key Christmas sales period. Sales during the period were strong ahead of the Diwali holiday when demand is likely to be hurt by the closure of polishing factories in India, said chief executive Bruce Cleaver. De Beers sold $490m of diamonds in the eight cycle of the year compared with $522m in the seventh and $467m for the eighth cycle last year. Anglo American said sales are provisional figures due to a change in the company's approach to diamond sales because of pandemic-related movement restrictions globally.¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 08:32¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/de-beers-diamond-sales-fall-in-eighth-cycle-wlrzue2dfb78eq3.html

The pound softened early Wednesday after data showed the UK inflation rate eased a touch last month. The consumer price index rose 3.1% year-on-year in September, slowing from August's 3.2% growth. Analysts had been expecting the September reading to remain stable at 3.2%, according to FXStreet. ""Annual inflation fell back a little in September due to the unwinding effect of last year's 'Eat Out to Help Out', which was a factor in pushing up the rate in August,"" said Mike Hardie, Head of Prices at the Office for National Statistics. The data comes after recent comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey that the UK central bank will have to act to ease inflationary pressures - leading to warnings from economists that the BoE could raise rates as soon as next month. ""That's why we, at the Bank of England, have signalled, and this is another such signal, that we will have to act,"" Bailey said, according to the Financial Times. ""But of course that action comes in our monetary policy meetings."" Sterling was quoted at USD1.3784 following the inflation data, soft on USD1.3800 at the London equities close on Tuesday. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Bank of England has a difficult balance to strike. On the one hand, the central bank is forecasting above-target 4% inflation in the current quarter, something higher interest rates could help to temper. Yet the economy is struggling with cost-push inflation partly on the back of surging commodity prices, which interest rates have less control over."" Also due on Wednesday is eurozone inflation, at 1000 BST. The flash reading of 1.9% year-on-year growth in consumer prices is expected to be confirmed. The euro traded at USD1.1628 early Wednesday, soft against USD1.1640 late Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar rose to JPY114.45 from JPY114.23. In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong shot up 1.1%. The S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney ended up 0.5%. Gold was quoted at USD1,775.37 an ounce early Wednesday, slightly higher than USD1,772.17 on Tuesday. Brent oil was trading at USD84.47 a barrel, easing from USD84.64 late Tuesday. At the top of the FTSE 100 in opening trade was Burberry, up 1.9% as investors cheered the appointment of a new chief executive. The British luxury fashion brand has found a replacement for Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti in the form of ex-Alexander McQueen boss Jonathan Akeroyd. Akeroyd, currently CEO of Milan-based Gianni Versace, will join Burberry to take up the same role on April 1, 2022. In his time at Versace, he has ""reorganised and accelerated growth at the iconic Italian fashion house"", Burberry said. He was previously CEO of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen. Gobbetti will leave Burberry at the end of 2021, and Gerry Murphy will chair the executive committee from this date until Akeroyd arrives. Antofagasta was at the bottom of the blue-chips, down 3.8% as the Chilean miner backed its 2021 copper production guidance, but moderated warned output is set to dip next year. Copper output in the third quarter was 181,100 tonnes, 1.5% higher than in the previous quarter on higher production at Centinela, partly offset by lower throughput at Los Pelambres. Cash costs before by-product credits in the third quarter were USD1.79 per pound, being 2 cents higher than the second quarter as the energy crisis pushed up input prices. For the full-year, guidance for copper production of 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes was unchanged. For 2022 however, Antofagasta now expects output of 660,000 to 690,000 tonnes. ""Since we last reported, there has been no material rainfall at our operations and as we head into the summer months, we do not expect any rain until the next rainy season, which begins in June next year,"" said Chief Executive Ivan Arriagada. ""The construction of the desalination plant at Los Pelambres is on track for completion in H2 2022 and we now anticipate group production in 2022 to be between 660,000 and 690,000 tonnes reflecting the previously advised production tonnes at risk at Los Pelambres due to the weather, and lower grades at Centinela concentrates."" Elsewhere in London, Deliveroo rose 1.9% as it raised its outlook following a ""strong"" third quarter performance despite the lifting of most remaining coronavirus restrictions in the UK during the period. The food delivery firm reported annual growth in gross transaction value of 54% in the third quarter of 2021 at GBP1.59 billion, describing orders as ""resilient"" despite lockdown restrictions being eased in the UK. It did note a ""modest"" reduction in average order value, with this slipping 6% year-on-year to GBP21.4 from GBP22.8. On the back of this, Deliveroo raised its full-year gross transaction value guidance to growth of 60% to 70%, versus prior guidance of 50% to 60%. Its margin outlook was unchanged, seen in a range of 7.50% to 7.75%. ""While we are mindful of current and potential macroeconomic disruptions and uncertainties, we expect further strong performance in the remainder of the year and we are increasing our full-year GTV growth guidance,"" said Founder & Chief Executive Will Shu.

UPDATE 1-Soccer-Bruce leaves role as Newcastle manager after takeover of club¬"(Adds quotes, details) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Steve Bruce has left his position as Newcastle United manager by mutual consent, the Premier League team said in a statement on Wednesday, two weeks after they were taken over by a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium. ""#NUFC can confirm that Steve Bruce has left his position as head coach by mutual consent. The club would like to place on record its gratitude to Steve for his contribution and wishes him well for the future."" The Premier League announced this month that Newcastle had been sold to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Bruce had said following the change of ownership that he would understand if he was replaced but he was allowed to take charge of the 1,000th match in his managerial career when Newcastle hosted Tottenham Hotspur in the league, losing 3-2 on Sunday. The signs were ominous, however, with the club's new director Amanda Staveley saying ""change does not always happen overnight"". ""I am grateful to everyone connected with Newcastle United for the opportunity to manage this unique football club,"" Bruce said in a club statement. ""I would like to thank my coaching team, the players and the support staff in particular for all their hard work. There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts."" Newcastle said Graeme Jones will lead the team on an interim basis, starting with Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace, and will be supported by the coaching team of Steve Agnew, Stephen Clemence, Ben Dawson and Simon Smith.

UPDATE 1-Sterling hits one-month high vs dollar as UK rate hike anticipation builds¬"(Updates prices, adds details) By Lawrence White LONDON, Oct 19(Reuters) - Sterling hit a four-week high against the dollar on Tuesday as expectations mount the Bank of England (BoE) will hike interest rates, while the greenback dipped as the rapid rise in U.S. Treasury yields in recent days stabilised. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey on Sunday sent perhaps the clearest signal yet of a pending hike, saying the BoE will ""have to act"" to deal with rising energy costs in Britain which threaten a surge in consumer prices. While many countries share Britain's problems of supply chain disruption, labour shortages and soaring energy prices, investors have singled it out as a country especially prone to inflation due in part to Brexit exacerbating bottlenecks. A November hike could make the BoE the first major central bank to increase rates since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic early last year. Bailey's comments had an immediate impact on bond yields on Monday, with yields on 2-year UK gilts (+13.1 bps) seeing their biggest daily rise since August 2015. The pound on Tuesday rose 0.6% to $1.3810, a level last seen on Sept. 17. Rising sovereign debt yields often have the impact of driving the associated currency higher as investors buy the bonds. The United States experienced the flipside of that dynamic on Tuesday, as a pause in Treasury yield growth reduced demand for the dollar.

UPDATE 3-Oil drops as China considers intervention to ease coal crunch¬"* Chinese coking coal and coke futures slide * API shows higher than expected rise in U.S. crude stocks * Market eyes EIA inventory data due later on Wednesday (Updates throughout, adds comment, changes dateline) By Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after the Chinese government stepped up efforts to tame record high coal prices and ensure coal mines operate at full capacity as Beijing moved to ease a power shortage. Brent crude futures dropped 73 cents, or 0.9%, to $84.35 a barrel at 1003 GMT, paring a 75 cent rise in the previous session, but still lingering close to multi-year highs. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for November, which expires on Wednesday, fell 68 cents, or 0.8%, to $82.28 a barrel. The more active WTI contract for December was down 80 cents, or 1%, to $81.64 a barrel. ""China is planning to take steps to combat the steep rises in the domestic coal market ... which could put considerable pressure on the coal price there and reverse the fuel switch to oil,"" Commerzbank said. Prices for Chinese coal and other commodities slumped in early trade, which in turn pulled oil down from an uptick earlier in the day. China's National Development and Reform Commission said on Tuesday it would bring coal prices back to a reasonable range and crack down on any irregularities that disturb market order or malicious speculation on thermal coal futures. Oil markets in general remain supported on the back of a global coal and gas crunch, which has driven a switch to diesel and fuel oil for power generation. But the market on Wednesday was also pressured by data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group which showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 15, according to market sources. That was well above nine analysts' forecasts for a rise of 1.9 million barrels in crude stocks, in a Reuters poll. However U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories, which include diesel, heating oil and jet fuel, fell much more than analysts had expected, pointing to strong demand. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later on Wednesday.

Nearly half of FTSE 100 companies have no net-zero target, Arabesque says ¬"LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Nearly half of the 100 biggest companies listed on Britain's FTSE Index have no net-zero target at all and just 23 have a scientifically approved plan, according to ESG investment research and asset manager Arabesque. Britain wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the economy to net-zero by 2050 while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed enthusiasm for leading a green revolution to force Western economies to kick their addiction to fossil fuels. Arabesque research found that 45 companies on the FTSE-100 index had no net zero target. Just 23 companies had set net zero targets meeting the standards of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which defines best practice in such targets. The research found that 28 FTSE companies are on course to contribute to a global temperature rise of 2.7 degrees Celsius or above by 2050. Scientists believe such a rise would lead to a worst-case climate scenario. The results of the research are a potential embarrassment for the British government just days before it hosts a major climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. ""These findings show a wide gulf between where the FTSE 100 stands today, and where it needs to be to deliver on the UK’s net zero target,"" Daniel Klier, president of Arabesque, said. ""Most of the UK’s biggest firms are not on a path to reach net zero by 2050 and we will need to see a significant change in business models and capital allocation."" Among the best performing 20 British FTSE-100 companies on climate were AstraZeneca, British American Tobacco , Burberry, Rolls-Royce and Unilever , Arabesque said. The worst performing companies, according to Arabesque, were miners and energy companies.

TOP NEWS: UK outlines net-zero strategy and green investment plans¬"(Alliance News) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday urged foreign investors to buy into post-Brexit Britain as he seeks to power future prosperity on renewable energy and green technology. His government also outlined more detailed plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, including a drive towards electric vehicles. The moves are part of a GBP90 billion plan that ministers say will support 440,000 jobs by 2030.Â Johnson is keen to burnish his green credentials before hosting world leaders at the UN's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow next month.Â He also wants to boost investment to grow the British economy as it grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, which have combined to strain the logistics sector, labour market and other areas. Climate experts gave only a cautious welcome, and campaigners said the moves did not go far enough. Johnson kicked off a Global Investment Summit in London by announcing a GBP400 million partnership with the Bill Gates Foundation to invest in ""the next generation of ground-breaking clean energy technologies"". The tie-up, which will see both sides stump up GBP200 million, follows Spanish renewable energy giant Iberdrola announcing plans to invest GBP6 billion to create Britain's biggest offshore wind development. In his sales pitch, Johnson promised government backing for private investment in sustainable projects, saying Britain was now ""moving in an exciting new direction with a green, industrial revolution, with new regulatory freedoms"". The investment summit, however, was attacked for ""corporate greenwashing"". Social activism group Global Justice Now noted four banks invited have invested a combined USD173 billion in fossil fuels in recent years. It also condemned the involvement of British energy giant Drax Group, which the NGO said released more emissions than Ghana in 2019. ""Our government is once again running cover for some of the biggest corporate climate villains in the world,"" Daniel Willis, of Global Justice Now, said. Campaigners also criticised the government's ""net zero strategy"" to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century, for lacking ambition and adequate funding. As well as boosting the production of electric vehicles, it offers homeowners in England and Wales subsidies of GBP5,000 from next year as part of a GBP450 million scheme to help them replace old gas boilers with low-carbon heat pumps. Writing in The Sun newspaper, Johnson sought to reassure homeowners they would not be compelled to rip out their existing boilers. ""While we're going to have to make some pretty major changes to the way we heat our homes, the Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi (boiler),"" he said. Experts noted the government had scrapped a prior scheme to improve homes' insulation, which is key for the pumps to work effectively, and that the grants will fund just 90,000 of the devices. Activists from the campaign group Insulate Britain have sought to highlight that issue by blocking motorways and main roads in recent weeks. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, said the government ""can't just keep dining out on its 'ambitious targets'"".Â ""Until the policy and funding gaps are closed, Boris Johnson's plea to other countries to deliver on their promises at the global climate conference next month will be easy to ignore,"" she added. The Gates Foundation tie-up â€“ run through the Microsoft co-founder's Breakthrough Energy CatalystÂ arm â€“ will focus on four key green technology areas. They inclue green hydrogen, long-term energy storage, sustainable aviation fuels and so-called direct air capture, which takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Appearing with Johnson, Bill Gates said the joint investment would begin next year, and he hoped that at least one of the four areas would be ""ready to scale"" within five years and the remainder within a decade. Iberdrola SA's wind project is one of 18 deals worth a total of GBP9.7 billion and creating a potential 30,000-plus jobs formally announced at the investment summit. Iberdrola and the UK government said the project off the east coast of England â€“ which still requires planning consent â€“ would supply enough energy to power 2.7 million homes and create 7,000 jobs.

MORNING BID-Margin pressures¬LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season. Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple, according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close. The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation. What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures. However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end. Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago. Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on  stock markets this morning. While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower. Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown. And Netflix could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19 -UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike -German PPI -Final Euro zone HICP -U.S. 20 year bond auction -Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles -Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen -European earnings: Vivendi, Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon, Nasdaq, Northern Trust, Tesla, IBM (Reporting by Sujata Rao, editing by Karin Strohecker)¬Wed, 20th Oct 2021 08:05¬https://www.lse.co.uk/news/morning-bid-margin-pressures-ihtevgbp641j5i4.html

Tatton assets under management reach £10.8bn in first half¬"(Sharecast News) - Tatton Asset Management reported assets under management of £10.79bn at the end of its first half on Tuesday, up from £8.99bn at the start of the period. The AIM-traded firm said net inflows in the six months ended 30 September totalled £0.65bn, while market and investment performance added a positive £0.5bn and the acquisition of Verbatim funds brought in £0.65bn. It said it delivered ""strong"" growth across all of its key metrics, including in revenue, profits and assets under management, as it traded in line with expectations. Its independent financial adviser support business Paradigm also continued to grow, with mortgage firms increasing to 1,646 from 1,612, and consulting member firms increasing to 418 from 407. Paradigm Mortgages saw an increase in market activity, driven by the stimulus of the UK government's stamp duty holiday, coupled with an improved lending environment. As a result, mortgage completions increased 30% year-on-year to £6.5bn, from £5bn at the end of the first half of the 2021 financial year. ""We continued to make excellent progress in the first six months of this financial year delivering very good growth across all parts of our business,"" said founder and chief executive officer Paul Hogarth. ""We are delighted to have reached £10.8bn of assets under management at the end of September.

German cheap flight hub Frankfurt Hahn files for insolvency¬BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Frankfurt Hahn Airport, a German international budget flights hub, has filed for insolvency, according to a court filing published on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear how the insolvency would affect flight operations. The airport, which is primarily used by low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and cargo airlines and served about 1.5 million passengers in 2019, is 82.5% owned by Chinese airport group HNA, while the German state of Hesse has a 17.5% stake. In February, a Chinese court opened insolvency proceedings against HNA at creditors' request, though China's Liaoning Fangda Group and Hainan Development Holdings have since said they could settle the debt HNA owes to retail investors. Jan Markus Plathner has been appointed provisional administrator for the insolvency proceedings, the report from the Bad Kreuznach District Court showed.

UPDATE 1-Britain fines Facebook $70 mln for breaching order in Giphy deal¬"(Adds Facebook response, details) LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has fined Facebook 50.5 million pounds ($69.6 million) for breaching an order imposed during its investigation into the U.S. social media giant's purchase of GIF platform Giphy, the agency said on Wednesday. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Facebook had deliberately failed to comply with its order, and the penalty served as a warning that no company was above the law. Facebook said it strongly disagreed. The CMA said Facebook had failed to provide full updates about its compliance with requirements to continue to compete with Giphy and not integrate its operations with Giphy's while its investigation was ongoing. Facebook had refused to report all the required information, despite multiple warnings, the CAM said, and it therefore considered the failure to comply deliberate. ""We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations,"" said Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA.

Tohoku Electric buys six LNG cargoes from BP in short-term deal¬"By Aaron Sheldrick and Marwa Rashad TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Tohoku Electric Power has signed a contract with BP for six cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), two trading sources told Reuters, avoiding paying record high prices on the spot market for short-term supplies. The cargoes will be delivered in the first half of next year and are priced at 20% of Brent crude, the sources said, translating to about $17 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at current prices. That is less than half the prevailing spot price in Asia of $38.50/mmBtu <LNG-AS>, a record high as an energy crisis engulfs much of the Northern Hemisphere, driving a rally in oil and pushing coal prices to historic highs. ""They should be happy with that price,"" said one of the trading sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A Tohoku Electric spokesperson said the utility would not discuss its fuel procurement strategy. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Japanese LNG buyers have said they would target short-term supply agreements when they need to top up long-term contractual cargoes of the superchilled fuel. Last winter they frantically competed with Chinese and South Korean buyers for cargoes in a tight spot market as freezing conditions hit the region for weeks on end, sending Japanese electricity prices to global records. This winter the regional crunch looks set to be played out on a global scale as Europe struggles for gas supplies, benchmark prices in the United States are around seven-year highs and economic growth in China is squeezed by power shortages. Tohoku's deal also underlines the absence of Japanese buyers in the spot market as they rely on long-term contract supplies of LNG, where the average price was just over $10 mmBtu in August, according to official trade figures. LNG inventories in Japan are also seasonally above average, but with electricity prices rising in recent weeks, Tokyo-based executives and traders say they are concerned about another winter of high prices and the threat of blackouts.
